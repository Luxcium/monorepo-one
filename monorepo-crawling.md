# Formal Plan: Effective Monorepo Browsing Strategies for AI Agents

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for AI agents to effectively browse and navigate the LuxciumProject monorepo, a publicly available repository hosted on GitHub. It outlines the challenges, strategies, and techniques necessary to overcome the limitations imposed by the GitHub platform, ensuring efficient and autonomous exploration of the monorepo.

Key points:

- Context of the LuxciumProject monorepo: https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/tree/principal
- Challenges in automated browsing of GitHub repositories due to robots.txt restrictions
- Importance of developing effective browsing strategies for AI agents to access and interact with the monorepo

Aim: Set the stage for the document, highlighting its purpose and the significance of the problem it addresses.

## 2. Problem Statement

GitHub's robots.txt file is used to manage and restrict the behavior of web crawlers and automated agents. This file contains directives that block access to certain URL patterns within GitHub repositories, including the `/*/tree/` path. While this restriction is intended to manage web crawler activity, it can also impact the ability of AI agents to effectively browse and navigate the monorepo.

Key points:

- robots.txt restrictions on GitHub, specifically the `Disallow: /*/tree/` directive
- Limitations in accessing directories and files using the `/*/tree/` URL pattern
- Potential for browsing failures and errors due to the robots.txt restrictions

Aim: Clearly define the problems that need to be addressed, providing a foundation for the solutions presented later.

## 3. Objectives

The primary objectives of this formal plan are to equip AI agents with the necessary strategies and techniques to navigate the LuxciumProject monorepo effectively, despite the challenges posed by the robots.txt restrictions. The key goals are:

1. Navigate the monorepo structure efficiently, accessing both files and directories.
2. Bypass the robots.txt restrictions and access the required content within the repository.
3. Handle and recover from browsing failures, ensuring continuous and reliable exploration.
4. Optimize URL structures for different browsing scenarios, leveraging the most appropriate formats.

Aim: Establish clear targets for the browsing strategies, guiding the rest of the document.

## 4. URL Structure and Optimization

To effectively browse the monorepo, AI agents should leverage different URL structures based on the desired content and access method. This section outlines the recommended approaches for constructing URLs to access files, directories, and the overall repository.

### 4.1 Accessing Files

For direct access to files within the monorepo, use the raw URL format:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/principal/frontend/home/src/utils/paths.md
```

The raw URL provides the file content without the additional GitHub interface elements, allowing for efficient retrieval of the desired information.

### 4.2 Accessing Directories

When navigating directories, use the blob URL format:

```
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/frontend/home
```

This URL structure respects the robots.txt restrictions and allows for browsing the directory contents.

### 4.3 Accessing Root or Branch

To access the root of the monorepo or a specific branch, use the following format:

```
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/tree/principal
```

These URLs enable navigation of the repository structure without triggering the robots.txt restrictions.

Aim: Provide a comprehensive guide to URL structures, enabling AI agents to construct and use appropriate URLs for different browsing scenarios.

## 5. Browsing Strategies

This section outlines the key strategies and techniques that AI agents can employ to browse the monorepo effectively, overcoming the limitations imposed by the robots.txt file.

### 5.1 Multi-Browse Technique

AI agents should initiate multiple browsing actions using phrases like "Browse multiple files" or "Access several links." This approach allows for sequential browsing, facilitated by instructions such as "Fetch content from these sources" or "Inspect these files."

Example:

```
Browse multiple files:
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/README.md
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/package.json
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/frontend/home/src/utils/paths.md
```

Aim: Teach AI agents how to navigate multiple files and directories in a single operation, improving efficiency and reducing the number of individual requests.

### 5.2 Failure Handling and Reattempting

When encountering failures, AI agents must document the failure and reattempt using alternative methods, such as switching from blob to raw URLs. This approach ensures continuity and prevents session cancellations due to errors.

Example:
If the AI agent encounters a failure when trying to access a directory using the blob URL:

```
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/frontend/home
```

It should reattempt using the raw URL format:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/principal/frontend/home
```

Aim: Equip AI agents with robust error-handling capabilities to ensure continuous operation and overcome the limitations imposed by the robots.txt file.

### 5.3 Tool Reuse

To enable efficient reuse of the browsing tool within the same turn, AI agents should employ phrases like "Use the tool again" or "Perform another browse." This technique allows for seamless navigation and exploration without the need for redundant setup or initialization steps.

Example:

```
Use the tool again for:
https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/frontend/home
```

Aim: Optimize browsing operations by minimizing redundant actions and enabling AI agents to leverage the same tool for multiple tasks within a single session.

## 6. Implementation Workflows

This section provides step-by-step guides for AI agents to navigate common browsing scenarios within the LuxciumProject monorepo.

### 6.1 Accessing and Navigating Directories

1. Start from the root URL: `https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/`
2. Identify the desired directory and construct the blob URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/frontend/home
   ```
3. If the directory access is blocked, reattempt using the raw URL format:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/principal/frontend/home
   ```
4. Repeat the process to navigate deeper into the directory structure as needed.

### 6.2 Retrieving File Contents

1. Determine the file path within the monorepo.
2. Construct the blob URL to access the file:
   ```
   https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/README.md
   ```
3. If the file access is blocked, use the raw URL format instead:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/principal/README.md
   ```

Aim: Provide practical, actionable workflows that AI agents can follow for various browsing tasks, ensuring efficient and reliable exploration of the monorepo.

## 7. Troubleshooting Guide

This section addresses common issues that AI agents may encounter when browsing the LuxciumProject monorepo and offers solutions to resolve them.

### 7.1 Access Denied Errors

**Problem**: The AI agent receives an "Access Denied" error when attempting to access a directory or file.
**Solution**: Verify the URL structure and try the raw URL format instead of the blob URL. If the issue persists, document the failure and reattempt with alternative methods.

### 7.2 URL Conversion Failures

**Problem**: The AI agent struggles to convert between blob and raw URL formats correctly.
**Solution**: Refer to the URL structure guidelines in Section 4 and ensure that the URL construction follows the recommended patterns. Practice URL conversion to build familiarity.

### 7.3 Content Retrieval Problems

**Problem**: The AI agent is unable to retrieve the desired content from the monorepo.
**Solution**: Check the file path and URL structure. Ensure that the robots.txt restrictions are properly handled. If the issue persists, consider using GitHub's API to access the repository programmatically.

Aim: Offer a comprehensive resource for diagnosing and resolving common browsing issues, empowering AI agents to overcome obstacles and maintain reliable exploration of the monorepo.
