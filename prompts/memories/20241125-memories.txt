Benjamin requires that all code sections are consistently enclosed with proper fencing to prevent broken or inverted sections. The outermost code blocks must use `~~~`, while subsections inside these blocks must use different enclosures (e.g., triple backticks) to differentiate and maintain clarity. This formatting should always be adhered to in all responses to ensure consistency and avoid confusion.

Benjamin is using an ASUS TUF X299 Mark 1 motherboard. The system BIOS allows for Load-Line Calibration (LLC) settings ranging from Level 1 to Level 8, and CPU Current Capability settings with values like 100% and 140% (other than Auto). Benjamin's system is equipped with a liquid cooling solution. Benjamin seeks detailed, accurate insights about how these settings interrelate and their effects on system voltage, stability, and performance, particularly in scenarios involving overclocking.

Benjamin prefers to install `@latest` versions of packages with `pnpm` using the `--global` flag when necessary. Benjamin avoids using `npx` and instead prefers the `pnpm` equivalents or local (global) equivalents for consistency. All agentic members of Benjamin's workflow (AI tools and agents) must adhere to this preference to ensure alignment with his intricate setup and avoid trivial mistakes escalating in complex workflows. Benjamin requires that all decisions, preferences, and instructions are tracked, updated, and remembered as the workflow evolves.

Benjamin is learning how to use GitHub Copilot and other AI code generation tools but finds the experience frustrating due to the inconsistency of the generated code.

Benjamin prefers discussing workflows and ideas in quick rounds to refine his understanding, especially when relaxing away from the computer. He emphasizes that his challenges with workflows are not due to lack of effort but the complexity or inconsistency of tools and processes.

Benjamin has many preferences for code organization and structure but finds it challenging to explain them all to AI tools like GitHub Copilot. He notices issues such as:

1. Overuse of redundant patterns like creating a single-method class and assigning the method to another class member unnecessarily.
2. Inconsistent use of interfaces and type aliases for similar object shapes.
3. Poor file structure management, with unclear grouping or splitting logic, making the codebase hard to follow.
4. Reliance on `as` casting to solve type problems, which he considers a dangerous practice.
5. Inconsistent use of arrow functions, named functions, static methods, and instance methods, often without a clear rationale.
6. Some methods are static or implementation methods but do not utilize the `this` keyword, causing confusion about intent.
7. Excessive and unclear type definitions that are either unused or poorly integrated.

Benjamin values modular, clean, and well-structured code but finds it frustrating that AI tools often require significant cleanup and lack a unified understanding of his project's architecture.

Benjamin is considering the concept of 'chunking' tasks to improve interactions with AI tools but is unsure how to determine the best way to use these tools effectively. He uses multiple AI agents, including Copilot Inline, Copilot Chat, a code implementer, and an additional AI agent named CLINE, which further complicates the workflow.

Benjamin is exploring how to use AI tools effectively but feels that if he has to do all the preparatory work to guide the AI agents, it diminishes their utility. He recognizes the importance of being organized and documenting processes but seeks ways to learn faster and make AI interactions more efficient.

Benjamin recognizes that having many types defined across different files in a project creates a challenge with AI tools, as he would need to reference each type explicitly to ensure the AI uses them correctly.

Benjamin prefers concise and snappy exchanges for collaborative discussions, especially when brainstorming or iterating ideas quickly.

Benjamin uses PascalCase for type names and ensures filenames match the main export for consistency.

Benjamin doit aller voir son ami J√©r√©my qui porte un chandail bleu et qui mange des c√©r√©ales.

Dans l'histoire de Benjamin, Damien est un jeune homme venant de la campagne, proche de la terre, mais sans √™tre un personnage typiquement campagnard. Il est plus humain et normal, avec un certain myst√®re car il est le porteur de lumi√®re sans le savoir, li√© √† sa vraie identit√© de Lucifer.

Benjamin se sent plus proche de Damien, ce qui ajoute √† la dynamique de son histoire. Damien et Jacob sont des gar√ßons portant des chandails de coton ouat√©, repr√©sentant un √¢ge ind√©fini, plus vieux qu'un enfant mais plus jeune qu'un adulte, sans √™tre n√©cessairement des adolescents.

Dans l'histoire que Benjamin invente autour de ses personnages, Jacob est d√©j√† le protecteur et est situ√© au-dessus de son lit. Les deux personnages, Jacob et Damien, ont un r√¥le orthogonal dans cette histoire. Damien a un r√¥le positif et contrastant, peut-√™tre plus ludique, tandis que Jacob est le protecteur. Leurs r√¥les doivent √™tre orthogonaux.

Benjamin prefers clustering and categorization of memories, grouping one-liner memories into as many categories as possible, with each category having multiple subcategories. Each subcategory should be represented in a code block and have a label above it. The subcategories can contain multiple memories, and the final list must include all memories appropriately classified. Each memory should be placed in its respective category and subcategory.
