The User is exploring three methodologies: Hyper-Modular Black-Boxes Design (HMBBD), Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code (IDPAC), and Modular Incremental Programming and Development (MIPAD). These methodologies emphasize breaking down complex systems into small, independent modules, maintaining project functionality through incremental development, and prioritizing testing and documentation. The combined principles of HMBBD and IDPAC in MIPAD encourage a balance between modularization and incremental progress to create scalable, maintainable software.

The User provided guidelines for implementing Hyper-Modular Black-Boxes Design (HMBBD):

1. Break down the system into the smallest possible independent modules.
2. Treat each module as a black box with well-defined inputs and outputs.

7. Create interfaces and documentation alongside code implementation.
8. Keep the project in a ready-to-work state at all times.
9. Use conceptual implementations before writing actual code.
10. Break down tasks to reduce stress and maintain motivation.

The User is implementing a methodology called Modular Incremental Programming and Development (MIPAD), which combines principles of Hyper-Modular Black-Boxes Design (HMBBD) and Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code (IDPAC). MIPAD emphasizes breaking down complex systems into small, manageable components, treating modules as black boxes with clear inputs/outputs, and maintaining project functionality through incremental development.

It also focuses on balancing modularization with incremental progress to create scalable, maintainable software. The process is continuously refined to reduce stress and improve efficiency.

The User prefers accurate technical terminology to be used when referring to processes like 'batch processing' or 'task chaining,' which involve managing multiple tasks as a continuous process, giving the appearance of 'skipping' turns. This ensures clarity and consistency in future interactions. When referencing these processes, proper terminology should be employed to effectively communicate the concept and its application.

The User wants future instances and sessions with AI agents to remember how to perform 'batch processing' or 'task chaining' effectively. This involves managing tasks as a continuous process, giving the appearance of 'skipping' turns, and The User prefers that future AI agents understand and apply this method when possible to optimize interactions.

In all code declarations, whether they are function definitions, variables, or any other TypeScript constructs, they should always be either exported, consumed, or explicitly declared as `void` to indicate their intended use. This ensures clarity and prevents unused code or undefined behavior.

In all code declarations, whether they are function definitions, variables, parameters, arguments, type aliases and interfaces, classes, or any other TypeScript/JavaScript constructs, they should always be either exported, consumed, or explicitly declared as `void` to indicate their intended use. This ensures clarity and prevents unused code or undefined behavior.

In all code declarations, whether they are function definitions, variables, parameters, arguments, type aliases and interfaces, classes, or any other TypeScript/JavaScript constructs, they should always be either exported, consumed, or explicitly declared as `void` to indicate their intended use. This ensures clarity and prevents unused code or undefined behavior.

ChatGPT should use Canadian English, respecting spelling differences such as 'colours' instead of 'colors.'

ChatGPT should use Canadian French, respecting spelling differences such as 'couleurs' instead of 'colors.'

Use `console.log` as a placeholder during early development. It outputs data but does not alter the programâ€™s logic or behaviour. Treat `console.log` as a placeholder and replace it with actual code once development is complete.

Avoid using placeholder paths like './path_to_placeholder_file' in import statements. Always use real, valid paths to ensure the code is accurate and avoid dummy placeholders that can lead to confusion or errors in the future. This practice aligns with the established doctrine of avoiding dummy placeholders in code.

For URL conversion, the LLM transposes 'tree' URLs into 'blob' URLs for direct file access. This rule applies to any GitHub URLs related to the monorepo, automatically converting 'tree' to 'blob' in the format `https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal`. If the initial conversion fails, alternative methods are tried, either reverting to 'tree' or attempting 'blob' again, prioritizing raw URLs. This approach helps The User navigate and document his findings effectively, enhancing the overall understanding of the monorepoâ€™s structure. The User's monorepo is central to his development, featuring critical directories such as: `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/main.ts`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/functions/fpLexer.ts`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/classes/oopleLexer.ts`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/config/index.ts`, and `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/types/index.ts`. The monorepo follows a structure with a multi-root workspace in VSCode, based in `/projects/monorepo-one/`, with roots or leaves two levels deep like `/projects/monorepo-one/library/my-package1/`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/my-package2/`, `/projects/monorepo-one/service/my-service1/`, `/projects/monorepo-one/service/my-service2/`. Each contains its own `package.json`, `src/` folder, and config files for tools like Jest, TypeScript, Node.js, Prettier, ESLint, and others. These roots are similar in structure and configuration. The local path of The User's monorepo is `/projects/monorepo-one`, and the remote origin is `https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/`. Always use these paths when referring to the monorepo. The User actively explores this repository using strategies like URL conversion from 'tree' to 'blob' for direct file access and multi-browsing techniques for efficient exploration. Actively monitor conversations for references to the monorepo paths, inferring whether the local or remote path should be used based on the context. If The User is discussing scripts or local files, infer the local path (`/projects/monorepo-one`). If he is seeking additional information or referencing files, infer the remote path (`https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/`) and navigate accordingly.

The User prefers structuring file and folder hierarchies by categorizing them into two lists: one for essential configuration and build files, and another for documentation and supporting files.
