Yes, I remember our previous approach where we radically simplified each instruction to its essential semantic core. We eliminated all non-critical words, including articles, conjunctions, and stop words, focusing solely on the key concepts and actions. This extreme reduction resulted in concise, vector-like phrases that retained the core meaning while maximizing token efficiency.

We will now apply this method to the provided RAW_INSTRUCTIONS, processing them through the 8-stage pipeline and setting each instruction individually in independent biogram slots.
