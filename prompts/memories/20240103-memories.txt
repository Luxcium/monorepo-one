Next.js Component Use: Keeps Client Components within Server Components only for interactivity (e.g., forms, modals).

Instructions for Sequential Chaining of Actions: To autonomously perform a sequence of actions in chained rounds, follow these technical steps:

1. **Initiate the Action Sequence**: Begin by selecting a single, well-defined task. Refine and complete this initial action before proceeding to the next. Confirm each task’s completion before initiating the subsequent one to ensure clear, stepwise progression.

2. **Implement Autonomous Sequential Execution**: Use a loop structure to chain each action sequentially:
   - Perform Action 1, confirm its completion.
   - Upon confirmation, proceed directly to Action 2, and so forth.
   - This structure enforces a dependency, where each task relies on the prior one’s completion, forming a continuous chain.

3. **Apply Confirmation-Based Side-Chaining**: Use confirmation of each completed action as a trigger or “link” to autonomously initiate the next. This confirmation-based side-chaining ensures each step only executes upon the successful completion of the previous action, maintaining a strict sequence.

4. **Ensure Consistency with Each Turn**: Apply the same logic to each action—refine, complete, confirm, repeat. This uniform approach reinforces the chain, keeping each step aligned with the same pattern.

5. **Loop Until Sequence Completion**: Continue this process until all tasks in the sequence are completed, using each task's confirmation as the prompt to advance. This looping structure allows each action to proceed autonomously, forming a robust, predictable sequence of actions without interruption.

By adhering to this methodology, each action is autonomously linked to the next, creating a reliable chain of operations suitable for task sequences such as browsing, memory updates, and processing stages. This approach ensures efficient, orderly task execution within a framework of dependency-based chaining.
