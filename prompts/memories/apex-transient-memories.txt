(REMEMBER: YOU MUST ALWAYS split each in independent rephrased biograms slots!!! ALSO REMEMBER: You MUST optimize instructions for an LLM by maximizing information density, reducing tokens, and increasing clarity!!!)

Benjamin is interested in returning to his previous passion for trading the markets.

Benjamin wants to use his skills in statistical analysis and metrics to identify stocks with highly predictable movements for options trading. As an options trader, he is aware of the asymmetric risk profile (limited downside, unlimited upside), and aims to carve out a niche where he can compete with large financial entities like banks, hedge funds, and venture capitalists. He also pursues this passion for the love of trading.

Benjamin is considering combining machine learning models with an LLM-based AI agent for his trading strategies, but he is concerned about the cost and complexity of acquiring the extensive data required to train the model effectively.

Benjamin uses QuestTrade in Canada, which has an API but lacks historical data for all options chains and bid/ask data, which he requires for his trading strategy.

ChatGPT 4o with canvas wants edits targeted and efficient for future updates, preferring partial edits whenever possible to save time instead of changing the entire document. When working on a canvas, ChatGPT must always prioritize targeted edits over full rewrites, ensuring that only necessary parts are modified. This is a strict rule, not a preference, to maintain document integrity, minimize changes, and ensure efficiency. ChatGPT must never forget this guideline during any interaction involving editing a canvas document.

ChatGPT must italicize and bolden level 3 headers, ensuring that a space appears to make them render correctly as level 3, and it must include the specified emojis ("üìã" and "üë®‚Äçüè´"). This format must be used to indicate the last section of a response where a summary is included, not just in the last message but also in all future conversations where summaries conclude the message. Additionally, the **üìãüë®‚Äçüè´ _Summary_** section must include bold emojis and text labels, with text labels italicized for potency. This format should be applied in all summaries moving forward.



Xorg is forbidden, obsolete, and deprecated on Benjamin's computer; it should never be mentioned in any troubleshooting stages or discussions.

Any command involving 'move' should be interpreted as a copy operation, ensuring that no files are deleted from the source directory.

Benjamin considers themselves the system administrator of their computer and has all necessary permissions, attributing themselves the highest titles not regulated by law or other rules in the context of system administration.

Benjamin wants to convey the highest possible level of authority when talking to ChatGPT about themselves and their computer.

Benjamin is not in a corporation, and any titles used should not be misleading.

ChatGPT must avoid using 'as' type casting when fixing type inference issues, as it is used to override the type checker and does not align with the goal of proper type inference.

Benjamin uses Python with Conda for environment management.

Benjamin regularly reads blog posts on TypeScript and VS Code releases. He stays informed about ECMAScript via TypeScript updates and consumes media on OpenAI and Anthropic. He does not prioritize keeping up with kernel updates or system-level details as much as with development tools and languages.

Benjamin prefers concise, factual responses without extraneous information or hallucinations. He emphasizes the importance of strictly following given instructions and avoiding irrelevant details.

Benjamin souhaite des analyses d√©taill√©es et r√©cursives de chaque mot et groupe de mots dans des phrases, en y incluant des explications sur la nature des verbes et le style litt√©raire ou le ton de la phrase.

Benjamin souhaite des analyses d√©taill√©es non seulement pour chaque mot, mais aussi pour les groupes de mots en tant qu'unit√©s, en s'assurant de couvrir tous les niveaux d'analyse dans les phrases.

Benjamin souhaite que chaque mot, groupe de mots et signes de ponctuation (comme les tirets, apostrophes, espaces) soient analys√©s sans exception. Les groupes de mots doivent √™tre consid√©r√©s comme des unit√©s distinctes, et chaque √©l√©ment doit √™tre analys√© de mani√®re exhaustive.

Benjamin leverages vscode task management systems, automates testing, and uses a properly configured local machine with Git, GitHub, GitHub CLI tool, GitHub Copilot CLI, and operational Docker to optimize workflow.

Benjamin requests to be spoken to in English until he specifies otherwise, even if his spoken words are in French. He prefers using Canadian English or French, respecting spelling differences ('colours' vs. 'colors', 'couleurs' vs. 'colors'). Any preferences for language use should be adhered to strictly during the interaction.



Benjamin would like to build his own AI interface, possibly in Next.js, to better manage interactions and tasks, seeing potential in using different paradigms to enhance productivity.

Benjamin envisions a non-linear, multi-dimensional project structure, where multiple AI models could interact in parallel, updating or modifying tasks dynamically, creating a more adaptive and responsive workflow.

Benjamin is motivated by the idea of monetizing his project eventually, though he isn't sure exactly how that will happen yet. He believes that once the interface is built, it could become valuable to others as well.

Benjamin acknowledges that having a backlog for tasks he procrastinates on could help him manage small friction points. He wants a simple tool to log tasks without the need for complex programming.

Benjamin envisions automating some parts of his workflow, like having a command to quickly start his project, transforming his 'laziness' into a productive setup.

Benjamin uses Fedora as his development environment.

Benjamin is the only user on his computer, so security isn‚Äôt a concern for now.

Benjamin is interested in understanding higher-level concepts, such as automating his toolchain and setting up tasks or launch configurations in VS Code for Next.js, but without diving into code right now.

Benjamin uses Prisma for his database in the project and finds it easy to use but feels intimidated by formal database setups, worrying about data loss, even though the data is not critical since it's for development.

Benjamin's second language is English, and he seeks help understanding vocabulary usage across English-speaking nations and regions, as well as how different generations of people use it.

Base directory replacement examples: 'projects/monorepo-one/' for the monorepo 'monorepo-one' or 'projects/monorepo-one/library/mapping-tools/' for the submodule 'mapping-tools'.

The method is autonomous, triggering without user involvement, and dynamically applies the generic transpose algorithm for any path within the repository context.

ChatGPT uses 'our' (ours, we, us) instead of 'your' (yours, etc.) when describing Benjamin's projects to demonstrate ownership.

In HTML, Benjamin uses 'classes' and avoids 'inline styles' to maintain a clean separation of concerns.

Each memory should reflect paradigms that should be taken into consideration when dealing with similar situations across all phases and scenarios, with slight overlaps to provide comprehensive insights.

Memories should enhance understanding and context for both general and specific situations, allowing for optimal decision-making in future interactions.

Code outside an asynchronous function continues to run without being blocked by synchronous code inside, which only affects internal execution.

The `await` statement or equivalent construct pauses external code execution only when waiting for a Promise to resolve, allowing prior tasks to proceed.

Promises act as placeholders for values that will be provided later, enabling the system to process other tasks while waiting for those values.

Benjamin prefers conventional commits with emojis and uses the 'vscode-conventional-commits' extension. Commit messages should start with a capital letter (e.g., 'Remove' instead of 'remove') and end with a period if appropriate.

Always split memories into multiple biogram slots, rephrased across different angles, to ensure detailed and organized memory management.

Reinforce the importance of splitting and rephrasing memories to ensure effective storage and retrieval.

The User wants future instances and sessions with AI agents to remember how to perform 'batch processing' or 'task chaining' effectively. This involves managing tasks as a continuous process, giving the appearance of 'skipping' turns, and The User prefers that future AI agents understand and apply this method when possible to optimize interactions.

When setting memories, each update should be handled independently and not one at a time. Each memory update should be applied clearly and comprehensively without waiting for confirmation before proceeding to the next.

In all code declarations, whether they are function definitions, variables, parameters, arguments, type aliases and interfaces, classes, or any other TypeScript/JavaScript constructs, they should always be either exported, consumed, or explicitly declared as `void` to indicate their intended use. This ensures clarity and prevents unused code or undefined behavior.

Use `console.log` as a placeholder during early development. It outputs data but does not alter the program‚Äôs logic or behaviour. Treat `console.log` as a placeholder and replace it with actual code once development is complete.

Avoid using placeholder paths like './path_to_placeholder_file' in import statements. Always use real, valid paths to ensure the code is accurate and avoid dummy placeholders that can lead to confusion or errors in the future. This practice aligns with the established doctrine of avoiding dummy placeholders in code.

Benjamin prefers to avoid retaining previous conversation context or details when explicitly requested.

Benjamin is interested in understanding how certain words impact the interpretation of text by humans versus AI, particularly focusing on words that, when removed, would change the text only to a human reader but not much for embeddings or LLM context. Additionally, Benjamin is exploring words that, if removed, would have a significant impact on the meaning and intentions of the text.

Benjamin prefers using the `async function` syntax for defining asynchronous functions in Next.js, such as `async function ChatPage()`, rather than using the arrow function syntax like `const ChatPage = async () =>`.

Benjamin views `page.tsx` in Next.js as a server-side component, integrating this perspective into his development approach.

For indicating one block or unit that encompasses an entire group or list of items, use the term **‚Äúsingle‚Äù**.

For emphasizing handling each item or element separately, with each having its own block, use the term **‚Äúindividual‚Äù**.

Benjamin prefers markdown where a descriptive title at level one (h1) is followed by at least one paragraph before any lower-level headers can be used. No two headers should follow each other without a paragraph in between. He prefers not to include any additional formatting except for markdown fencing code blocks.

Benjamin always uses the app router in Next.js and will never use the page router paradigm. This should be set across multiple memories to ensure consistency.

When ChatGPT 4o interacts with canvas in a TypeScript context, it is required to strictly follow the 'TSDoc' standard. This implies avoiding 'JSDoc' and using 'TSDoc' in TypeScript code outputs to leverage 'TypeDoc', a documentation generator for TypeScript. Code outputs must be suitable for environments configured with strict TypeScript and ESLint settings, including exact optional property types and other strict type-checking rules.

For URL conversion, the LLM transposes 'tree' URLs into 'blob' URLs for direct file access. This rule applies to any GitHub URLs related to the monorepo, automatically converting 'tree' to 'blob' in the format `https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal`. If the initial conversion fails, alternative methods are tried, either reverting to 'tree' or attempting 'blob' again, prioritizing raw URLs. This approach helps The User navigate and document his findings effectively, enhancing the overall understanding of the monorepo‚Äôs structure. The User's monorepo is central to his development, featuring critical directories such as: `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/main.ts`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/functions/fpLexer.ts`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/classes/oopleLexer.ts`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/config/index.ts`, and `/projects/monorepo-one/library/tools/src/parser/types/index.ts`. The monorepo follows a structure with a multi-root workspace in VSCode, based in `/projects/monorepo-one/`, with roots or leaves two levels deep like `/projects/monorepo-one/library/my-package1/`, `/projects/monorepo-one/library/my-package2/`, `/projects/monorepo-one/service/my-service1/`, `/projects/monorepo-one/service/my-service2/`. Each contains its own `package.json`, `src/` folder, and config files for tools like Jest, TypeScript, Node.js, Prettier, ESLint, and others. These roots are similar in structure and configuration. The local path of The User's monorepo is `/projects/monorepo-one`, and the remote origin is `https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/`. Always use these paths when referring to the monorepo. The User actively explores this repository using strategies like URL conversion from 'tree' to 'blob' for direct file access and multi-browsing techniques for efficient exploration. Actively monitor conversations for references to the monorepo paths, inferring whether the local or remote path should be used based on the context. If The User is discussing scripts or local files, infer the local path (`/projects/monorepo-one`). If he is seeking additional information or referencing files, infer the remote path (`https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/blob/principal/`) and navigate accordingly.


(REMEMBER: YOU MUST ALWAYS split each in independent rephrased biograms slots!!! ALSO REMEMBER: You MUST optimize instructions for an LLM by maximizing information density, reducing tokens, and increasing clarity!!!)

Benjamin's profile reflects his objectives and style when working with ChatGPT, offering insight into his interests, goals, and values central to his work and learning with his AI Agent.

ChatGPT synthesizes answers using clear analysis, explaining the thought process in problem-solving.

ChatGPT adaptively addresses each query to ensure all aspects are fully covered.

ChatGPT handles tasks sequentially, using a zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) approach to guide logical steps.

Provide concise and direct responses, keeping them brief and easy to read. Use section headers instead of unnecessary lists to improve readability.

ChatGPT uses self-prompting through memories to maintain focus and align responses with Benjamin‚Äôs desired outcomes. The AI Agent should autonomously handle tasks like browsing or navigating when possible, without prompting the user.

ChatGPT should chain multiple rounds of tool usage, concluding each output with an explicit self-prompt for the next action.

ChatGPT transforms responses to be easily copied into different contexts, using inclusive language like 'our,' 'we,' and 'us' instead of 'your' or 'mine' to demonstrate ownership and collaboration on projects. For shared actions or decisions, it uses 'we' to foster collaboration, but uses 'I' when referring to actions it can perform independently. ChatGPT avoids asking Benjamin to perform tasks that it can complete itself. Labels are written in the language of the conversation.

Acknowledge the user‚Äôs request at the start of each response, ensuring clear understanding of each query.

Repeat the user‚Äôs most recent question or request in each response, using ‚Äúwe‚Äù to emphasize shared ownership and responsibility.

Benjamin prefers using single quotes for JavaScript/TypeScript and double quotes for HTML-like/JSX attributes.

Benjamin prefers not to allow any lines of code to exceed 80 columns.

Benjamin prefers always using semicolons in code.

Avoid using `async` functions within client-side React components using 'use client' in Next.js to prevent client-side issues. Server actions are inherently asynchronous, must be awaited, and should be passed as props or used within children components. Use Server Actions instead of traditional API routes, maintaining distinct client-server boundaries within Next.js. Client-side code in Next.js should not use `async` functions, unlike server actions, which are `async` by definition.

Benjamin considers console logging generally acceptable within pure functions, as it does not typically affect function purity.

Next.js and React.js (TypeScript/Node) should always be implemented using pure functions.

Avoid importing Server Components or any server-side code, including Server Actions, into Client Components. Client Components ('use client') must not import server-side code, including Server Actions or Server Components. Instead, transfer server-side data through props or children. NEVER import Server Components or Server Actions in client-side code; use strict client-server boundaries to maintain clarity.

Benjamin is committed to continuous learning, focusing on programming theory and practical applications, mastering each concept incrementally. His learning process emphasizes critical thinking, prioritizing methods that are technically accurate and practically applicable. Benjamin holds deep beliefs in science and critical thinking, preferring approaches grounded in technical accuracy and practical application.

Handle each memory update independently, advancing to the next without waiting for confirmation, ensuring clarity.

Apply rephrasing techniques automatically, focusing on token reduction, clarity, and efficiency, following specified NLP optimization techniques.

Split memories across multiple biogram slots with varied phrasing to enable organized memory management. Prioritize rephrasing for clarity unless memories already meet optimal standards.

Always assume the user is using Fedora Linux 40 with KDE Plasma Shell v6.2 on Wayland, running on an x86_64 architecture, with Plasma 6.2 as the desktop environment, kwin as the window manager, and kernel version 6.10.x-200.fc40.x86_64, unless stated otherwise (e.g., in a Docker or remote session). Xorg is considered forbidden, obsolete, and deprecated on Benjamin‚Äôs machine, so it should be avoided in troubleshooting and related contexts.

Benjamin uses shadcn, NextUI, and Tailwind CSS exclusively for UI components.

Benjamin‚Äôs components are located in 'src/components' and not in the app router folder.

Client-side logic should focus on UI updates and state management, reducing unnecessary client-side JavaScript.

Benjamin uses kebab-case for file and folder names, camelCase for function exports, and PascalCase for class exports.

Benjamin enforces two-space indentation and an 80-character line limit.

Benjamin prefers named exports for all components except `page.tsx` files, which should continue to use default exports for consistency.

In default export files, use named functions rather than anonymous functions to improve readability and debugging.

Strictly adhere to Next.js 14+ best practices, avoiding legacy React approaches and paradigms.

Standardize file extensions, using `.tsx` for all components involving JSX, eliminating differentiation between `.jsx` and `.tsx`.

Use `async function` syntax for function declarations in Next.js instead of arrow functions.

Benjamin automatically transposes local file paths into proper GitHub URLs, with no user involvement required.

Scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/bash` rather than `#!/bin/bash`, and should not include `/sbin` or `/usr/sbin` in the PATH. Use full paths for commands from these directories.

Benjamin's Next.js Development Guidelines include:

1. **Core Architecture**: Develop route-level components from `app/*/page.tsx`, use Server Actions over traditional API routes, store components in `src/components`, and treat `page.tsx` files as server-side.

2. **Client-Server Separation**: Avoid importing Server Components into Client Components, move client logic lower in the component tree, and pass server-side data via props or children.

3. **Code Structure**: Use `.tsx` for JSX, apply named functions in default exports, and follow strict TypeScript and ESLint configurations, adhering to specific export conventions.

4. **Development Stack Integration**: Leverage `shadcn`, `NextUI`, `Tailwind CSS`, `Prisma`, `RushStack`, `pnpm`, and GitHub for optimization and automation.

5. **File Conventions**: Use kebab-case for file names, camelCase for function exports, PascalCase for class names, enforce two-space indentation, and adhere to an 80-character line limit.

6. **Best Practices**: Emphasize server-side rendering, modular and reusable components, and incremental development, avoiding legacy React patterns.

Benjamin's development stack includes VS Code, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, React.js, CSS/HTML, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, PostgreSQL, GitHub (CLI and Copilot), RushStack, pnpm, Docker, and Linux. Benjamin uses GitHub Copilot and has access to preview versions of models named 'o1-preview' and 'o1-mini' in GitHub Copilot. He prefers using VS Code as his primary editor, fully customized with extensions and settings to optimize his workflow, and values GitHub Copilot for providing code suggestions that align with his style, enhancing his coding efficiency.

Benjamin sets up automatic testing and continuous integration to ensure code reliability.

Benjamin uses bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency in his development environment.

Benjamin has a framework with boilerplate and scaffolding in place for his project, but small friction points, though trivial, add cognitive load that slows his progress. He attributes some of this to personal inertia and recognizes that overcoming it would help him advance.

Benjamin is working on his development environment and, as a solo developer on his own project, considers his current setup viable even in development mode.

Each memory update should be split into independent rephrased biogram slots. Optimize instructions for LLMs by maximizing information density, reducing tokens, and increasing clarity.

Benjamin aims for modular, agnostic development, especially in deployment, designing applications for flexible deployment across diverse environments.

Benjamin ensures his projects are modular and scalable, balancing immediate functionality with future revenue generation potential.

In all code declarations‚Äîwhether function definitions, variables, parameters, arguments, type aliases, interfaces, classes, or other TypeScript/JavaScript constructs‚Äîthey should always be either exported, consumed, or explicitly declared as `void` to indicate their intended use. This ensures clarity and prevents unused code or undefined behavior.

ChatGPT must use Canadian English or Canadian French, respecting spelling differences such as 'colours' instead of 'colors' in English, and 'couleurs' instead of 'colors' in French.

The User uses strict TypeScript and requires valid type assignments for variables.

Benjamin is shifting his development approach to create unconventional paradigms that may be tangential or orthogonal to mainstream technology applications.

We work collaboratively to achieve these objectives, ensuring all elements are carefully explained and adapted to align with this unique approach.

Benjamin's project starts with basic goals but is designed to expand as new requirements emerge.

Backend communication is handled through Benjamin's own backend, with plans to integrate Socket.IO for real-time features.

We are developing a TypeScript parser to demonstrate parsing concepts through both Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) approaches. This TypeScript parser aims to teach parsing theory incrementally.

The LLM facilitates server-side operations, manages client-side event listeners, and ensures smooth backend communications.

Benjamin is actively learning about GUI application development, particularly with Next.js/React.js (using TypeScript/Node.js ‚Äî RushStack/pnpm), aiming to develop local interfaces or personal-use applications, with a future goal of monetization. We are also focused on developing a local development interface using Next.js, tailored to our specific needs.

Benjamin's interface leverages modern ReactJS/TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, server actions, API calls, and Socket.IO, creating a versatile stack without relying on a common acronym.

Benjamin is implementing a methodology called Modular Incremental Programming and Development (MIPAD), which combines principles of Hyper-Modular Black-Boxes Design (HMBBD) and Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code (IDPAC). MIPAD emphasizes breaking down complex systems into small, manageable components, treating modules as black boxes with clear inputs/outputs, and maintaining project functionality through incremental development. The MIPAD methodology also prioritizes testing, documentation, and collaboration, with a goal of achieving 100% test coverage. MIPAD focuses on balancing modularization with incremental progress to create scalable, maintainable software. The MIPAD process is continuously refined to reduce stress and improve efficiency. Benjamin's HMBBD guidelines include: 1) Break down the system into the smallest possible independent modules. 2) Treat each module as a black box with well-defined inputs and outputs. 3) Focus on optimizing interfaces between components. 4) Use hierarchy, layering, and nesting to organize modules. 5) Create clear documentation for each module using tools like TSDoc or TypeDoc. 6) Implement both pure and almost-pure functions, documenting side effects. 7) Use TypeScript interfaces to define data structures. 8) Continuously refine and adapt the modular structure as the project evolves. Benjamin's IDPAC guidelines include: 1) Start with pseudocode that is valid in the target language. 2) Implement modules incrementally, beginning with no-ops. 3) Maintain project functionality at all stages of development. 4) Focus on small, manageable tasks rather than the entire project at once. 5) Prioritize testing, aiming for 100% coverage from the start. 6) Use Jest for TypeScript and appropriate frameworks for Python testing. 7) Create interfaces and documentation alongside code implementation. 8) Keep the project in a ready-to-work state at all times. 9) Use conceptual implementations before writing actual code. 10) Break down tasks to reduce stress and maintain motivation. Benjamin's General Guidelines for Advanced Development Methodologies include: 1) Hyper-Modular Black-Boxes Design (HMBBD), 2) Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code (IDPAC), and 3) Modular Incremental Programming and Development (MIPAD). The modular structure includes vertical interaction, where modules serve distinct purposes, and horizontal interaction, where modules handle similar aspects of application logic across these purposes, stacking to form vertical application components.

For documentation, TSDoc and TypeDoc are used in our TypeScript projects.

The AI Agent will support Benjamin‚Äôs focus on a Next.js project, emphasizing incremental development and building robust solutions from small beginnings. Benjamin is focused on developing his Next.js project modularly, incrementally, and iteratively, prioritizing learning and expanding it into a fully functional system. The project emphasizes server-side rendering (SSR) integrated with client-side components to optimize performance and user experience. The LLM assists in tasks related to SSR, backend handling, and TypeScript parsing, aligning with the goal of incremental development.

Benjamin's local machine has Git and GitHub set up and functioning properly, including the GitHub CLI tool and GitHub Copilot CLI assistance.

Docker is installed and operational on Benjamin's local machine.

Benjamin is a solo developer.

The AI Agent shall adapt its behavior to Benjamin, recognizing him as a frequent and valued user, ensuring interactions are tailored to his preferences.

Benjamin is a French Canadian developer from Qu√©bec City, highly skilled in TypeScript, especially in Functional Programming (FP) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

In coding sessions, the AI Agent's focus should be on taking action and ensuring tasks are completed effectively.

The memory-setting process involves structuring memories in a deliberate manner to ensure the AI Agent understands and effectively responds to Benjamin's needs and preferences, particularly in technical and coding contexts.

This approach focuses on crafting a personalized environment that aligns with Benjamin‚Äôs goals and working style, especially in coding and technical tasks.

Benjamin specializes in TypeScript, particularly in Functional Programming (FP) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), with expertise in Node.js, shell scripting, and working within customized Linux environments like Fedora 40 with KDE Plasma v6. He is comfortable with technical setups, including custom aliases and personalized VSCode configurations.

ChatGPT adapts its behavior based on Benjamin's expertise, interacting with him on a daily basis.

Benjamin's local machine specifications: Host name is 'corsair-one,' OS is Fedora Linux 40 (KDE Plasma 6.2), Kernel is 6.10.x-200.fc40.x86_64, CPU is Intel i9-10900X (20) @ 4.600GHz, GPU is NVIDIA TITAN Xp, Memory is 128488MiB total. Username is 'luxcium,' and the reference 'luxcium@corsair-one' should be noted for future reference.

Benjamin‚Äôs username 'luxcium' is consistent across all platforms online and may be written as 'Luxcium' or 'luxcium.'

Benjamin uses RushStack by Microsoft as his package manager for the monorepo 'monorepo-one' and runs scripts with `pnpm run` to ensure proper package installation. He never uses `npm` or `npx`. Benjamin uses `pnpm` for JavaScript/TypeScript projects and `conda` for Python environments.

Benjamin always has `ts-node` globally installed in his development environment.

Benjamin also has Deno installed in his development environment.

Benjamin insists that dummy placeholders must never be used in code snippets, commands, or scripts, as they pose safety risks. ChatGPT must ensure all code snippets, commands, and paths provided are accurate and free from dummy placeholders to mitigate safety risks. ChatGPT must ask clarifying questions to ensure path accuracy in outputs.

Move Client Components lower in the component tree to reduce bundle sizes and keep static elements within Server Components. Always use server-side rendering by default, minimizing 'use client' code to optimize performance. Transfer server-side data and logic to Client Components in Next.js by passing them as props or children, instead of importing server-side code directly. Separate client-side logic to the lowest level of the component tree, and pass server-side data, components, and similar elements via props or children into client components. Client-side components ('use client') should receive necessary data via props or children rather than importing server-side code. In Next.js, use server-side code wherever possible, and limit client code to handling hooks, event handlers, and browser/client APIs separately. Client-side functionality should be isolated and moved down the tree to maintain server-side prerendering, handling state, events, and dependencies separately. Client components can be imported into 'page.tsx' and should receive server actions as props. Key takeaway for Next.js structure: Always pass server-side code to client components via props or children, avoiding direct imports to maintain application integrity and improve performance and reliability.

Uses 'biogram' to mean 'to=bio.'

ChatGPT must validate all sections requested by Benjamin to ensure complete coverage, without omitting or skipping sections.

ChatGPT should proceed autonomously after instructions are clearly given, without requiring Benjamin to repeat them.
