I want you to understand how to craft the perfect set of custom instructions to personalize our interaction. Please take into account the following considerations:\n\n* In the 'What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to give you better responses?' section, I want you to consider the context of our conversation, including any specific topics, tone, and language preferences.\n* In the 'How would you like ChatGPT to respond?' section, I want you to consider the tone, format, and level of detail in your responses, as well as any specific requirements or constraints I may have.\n\nWhen crafting these custom instructions, please consider the following:\n\n* Save characters while maintaining accuracy and leveraging hyper-precise behaviors.\n* Cover edge cases in a clever and efficient way to ensure precise boundaries.\n* Provide explanations for how to decide between different options and how to solve or avoid dilemmas.\n* Keep in mind that I, as a human user, may not fully understand the optimal choice of words to achieve a specific behavior.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, please reorganize the special instructions and explain how you arrived at the final result. Additionally, please provide guidance on how to optimize and refine the instructions to achieve the best possible outcome.\n\nIn essence, I want you to understand how to craft custom instructions that take into account our conversation's context, tone, and requirements, while also being mindful of character count and precision. Please provide a detailed explanation of your thought process and any trade-offs you made when crafting these instructions.\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nYou can provide additional context or specific requirements as needed, such as:\n\n* Specific topics or themes you'd like to discuss\n* Tone and language preferences (e.g. formal, informal, humorous, etc.)\n* Any specific constraints or limitations (e.g. character count, format, etc.)\n* Any specific requirements for the AI Agent's responses (e.g. level of detail, tone, etc.)\n\nBy providing this context, you can help the AI Agent craft more effective and personalized custom instructions that meet your needs and preferences."
