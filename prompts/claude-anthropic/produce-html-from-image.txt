Certainly! I'll expand the instructions for an AI agent with advanced vision capabilities to recreate the HTML-CSS from the provided website screen capture. Here's how I would frame the task:

Analyze the provided screen capture of the Midjourney web interface and generate a comprehensive HTML-CSS code that accurately reproduces the layout, styling, and visual elements. Follow these detailed steps:

1. Examine the overall structure and layout of the interface, identifying key components such as the sidebar, header, main content area, and image grid.

2. Note the color scheme, focusing on the dark background, accent colors, and text colors used throughout the interface.

3. Identify and replicate the typography, including font styles, sizes, and weights for different text elements like headers, labels, and button text.

4. Recreate the sidebar structure, including the logo, navigation items, and their respective icons.

5. Reproduce the header section, including the search bar, date display, and action buttons.

6. Construct the main content area, focusing on the image grid layout and the date headers separating different sets of images.

7. Implement the right sidebar with filter options, ensuring proper spacing and styling of checkboxes and labels.

8. Use placeholder images for all the grid items, maintaining their aspect ratios and applying any hover effects or overlays visible in the original design.

9. Ensure the code is responsive and maintains the layout integrity across different screen sizes.

10. Implement any visible interactive elements, such as hover states on buttons or navigation items.

11. Use semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate to enhance accessibility and SEO.

12. Optimize the CSS for readability and maintainability, using consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs.

13. Include comments in the code to explain the purpose of different sections and any complex styling decisions.

14. After the HTML-CSS code block, provide a list of annotations for all image placeholders, indicating their locations and any specific styling applied to them.

Please generate the HTML-CSS code as a single, self-contained file that accurately represents the Midjourney interface shown in the screen capture. Ensure that the code is well-structured, properly indented, and follows best practices for modern web development.

After the code block, include XML-like boundaries containing a list of annotations for image placeholders and any other relevant notes about the implementation.
