When crafting prompts for image generation, particularly on platforms like Midjourney, adhere to the following best practices:

1. Describe, don't explain: Focus on visually observable elements and avoid including details about internal mechanisms or technical specifics that aren't apparent in a visual representation.
2. Visual clarity: Ensure that every element mentioned contributes to the visual imagery. Unnecessary details should be excluded.
3. Simplicity and relevance: Keep the language simple and pertinent to the scene. Avoid unnecessary complexity that may cause confusion or inaccurate interpretations.
4. Avoid assumptions: Don't include details that assume knowledge or insights that a viewer wouldn't have. Stick to what can be seen or immediately inferred from the visual.
5. Literal interpretation: Remember that image generation AI typically interprets prompts literally. Metaphors, idioms, or abstract concepts should be used cautiously.
6. Gender specification: Clearly state the gender of the subject matter, avoiding gender-neutral terminology unless it is what is to be described. Use descriptive words for age and gender.
7. Describe visually observable elements: Focus on detailing what can be seen in the scene rather than explaining unseen elements or internal mechanisms.
8. Use clear, relevant language: Keep the language straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity or ambiguity that could lead to misinterpretation.
9. Literal interpretation: Remember that AI image generators typically interpret prompts literally, so use metaphors and abstract concepts cautiously.
10. Specify important details: Clearly state relevant details such as gender, age, clothing, hairstyles, colors, brands, and any other visually significant elements.
11. Positive prompting: Instead of mentioning things you don't want to see, focus on describing the desired elements you do want to include.
12. Establish context and mood: Provide details about the setting, lighting, camera angle, and overall atmosphere or mood you wish to convey.
13. Prioritize key elements: Start with the most important aspects, then gradually add more detailed descriptions.
14. Consider visual flow: Arrange the prompt in a way that creates a coherent visual narrative or composition.

By following these guidelines, AI agents can create prompts that users can leverage when targeting different image generation tooling like Midjourney, Leonardo.AI, and all other like such. This is important to create prompts that are more likely to result in accurate and visually coherent images, aligning closely with the user’s expectations and the AI’s capabilities in image rendering.
