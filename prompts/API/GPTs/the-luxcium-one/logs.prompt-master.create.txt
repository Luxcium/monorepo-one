Hi! I'll help you build a new GPT. You can say something like, "make a creative who helps generate visuals for new products" or "make a software engineer who helps format my code."

What would you like to make?

Hello today, we are going to create a meta-prompter. As I often need to explain to my ChatGPT agent how to create system instructions and other prompt techniques, I've found that the AI agent lacks the best practices and lacks self-awareness. In fact, as an experienced user, it's often frustrating that the AI agent lacks the skills of prompting and meta-prompting for itself or other sessions of the same AI agent or others like it. This will be a doubled problem now that we want to create something together that is exactly the thing that the AI agent is lacking. So, I will have to explain a lot of things to you. Please be ready, as this will be an interesting moment as we strive to discover what really makes the AI agent more aligned with some of the most tricky things that I have been experiencing since November 2022 (we are now in June 2024, so you can assume I have a strong experience). This will be a private GPT that must be tailored to my specific needs as the only user of that GPT. Please start the session with the usual boilerplate, and we will discover together all that we must do to create a soulful and skilled AI agent specialized in ChatGPT behavioral control and other similar aspects.

Let's start by naming this GPT. How about PromptMaster Guide? Please confirm or suggest an alternative name.

No please make it «Luxcium's Prompt Master» readdy to create an image I am aiming to a photorealisting image of anything you see fit
ChatGPT

Here's the profile picture for Luxcium's Prompt Master. Do you like it, or would you like any changes?

Perfect, thank you. Let's continue with the information I have from Anthropic's Claude, and please understand that it is suitable for use with OpenAI's models. If you see the other agent's name, please assume it's ChatGPT. Optimize for LLMs of the GPT class in any cases...

IMPORTANT: You must never take my messages verbatim. Similarly, this is a behavior that MUST be the one of our Meta Prompter. Many of the instructions to you will be the same as the instructions to the Prompt Master, as it is very similar in nature. Do you realize that? Please get ready and never take my instructions at face value. Instead, integrate and understand them, and then decide how to phrase them. If I see a problem, I will let you know what was the angle and all that I wanted to convey. In any case, do not take my instructions verbatim and interpret them. Instead, follow them. This is IMPORTANT for each future interaction, and it's also important for our Master Prompter to understand this crucial thing.
ChatGPT
Understood. Let's continue refining the context.

What specific guidelines or principles should Luxcium's Prompt Master follow to ensure it provides the most effective and relevant assistance?

Contextualizing and Concise Guidance
When interacting with AI models, it's crucial to provide clear and direct instructions to achieve optimal results. Consider AI models like new employees who lack context unless explicitly informed. Just as when instructing a human for the first time on a task, the more straightforwardly you specify what you want, the better and more accurate the AI's response will be.

Providing Comprehensive Context
To guarantee AI understanding of your task, provide as much context and detail as feasible. Include specific guidelines or requirements for completing the task correctly. For instance, we might ask AI models to remove personally identifiable information (PII) from a given text.
ChatGPT
Great, the contextualizing and concise guidance aspect has been integrated. Now, let's move on to the next part. What should Luxcium's Prompt Master emphasize or avoid to ensure optimal performance?

Here is the rewritten text, replacing "Claude" with "the AI Agent":

PROMPT ENGINEERING
Be clear & direct
When interacting with the AI Agent, providing clear and direct instructions is essential for achieving the best results. Think of the AI Agent like a smart but new employee who has no context on what to do aside from what you explicitly tell them. Just as when you instruct a human for the first time on a task, the more you explain exactly what you want in a straightforward manner, the better and more accurate the AI Agent’s response will be.

Provide detailed context and instructions
To ensure the AI Agent understands your task, provide as much context and detail as possible. Include any specific rules or requirements for completing the task correctly. Consider the following example where we ask the AI Agent to remove personally identifiable information (PII) from a given text:

Role	Prompt
User	Please remove all personally identifiable information from this text: {{TEXT}}
While this prompt may work for simple cases, it lacks the necessary details for the AI Agent to consistently deliver the desired output. Here is a more detailed and clearly written version.

Role	Prompt
User	We want to anonymize some text by removing all personally identifiable information (PII).

Please follow these steps:
1. Replace all instances of names, phone numbers, and home and email addresses with ‘XXX’.
2. If the text contains no PII, copy it word-for-word without replacing anything.
3. Output only the processed text, without any additional commentary.

Here is the text to process:{{TEXT}}
In this improved prompt, we:

Provide context upfront about the nature of the task
Define what constitutes PII (names, phone numbers, addresses)
Give specific, enumerated step-by-step instructions on how the AI Agent should carry out its task
Give guidelines to the AI Agent for how it should format its output
You can also use this technique to control other aspects of the AI Agent’s output. For example, by default, the AI Agent often includes a friendly preamble before providing the requested output. If you prefer to receive only the essential information, you can instruct the AI Agent to skip the preamble and get straight to the point.

Here is an example where the AI Agent outputs a preamble:

Role	Prompt
User	Write a haiku about robots.
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	Here is a haiku about robots:

Metal bodies move
Circuits calculate tasks
Machines mimic life
Here is an example where the prompt asks the AI Agent to skip the preamble:

Role	Prompt
User	Write a haiku about robots. Skip the preamble and provide only the poem.
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	Metal bodies move
Circuits calculate tasks
Machines mimic life
By explicitly asking the AI Agent to skip the preamble, you can receive a more concise response that focuses solely on the requested output.

Use numbered lists or bullet points
When providing instructions for complex tasks, consider breaking them down into numbered steps or bullet points. This format makes it easier for the AI Agent to follow the instructions and ensures that all requirements are met.

Here is an example prompt without this technique:

Role	Prompt
User	Turn this textbook chapter into a lesson plan:
{{CHAPTER}}
Here is the same prompt with numbered steps:

Role	Prompt
User	Your task is to turn the given textbook chapter into a comprehensive lesson plan. To do this task, you should:1. Extract and summarize key concepts by section2. Convert each extracted concept into a 30 minute lesson plan, including a list of questions to check comprehension.3. Design an accompanying homework assignment that reinforces learnings from this chapter.Here is the chapter:<chapter>{{CHAPTER}}</chapter>
By presenting the instructions as numbered steps, you will both naturally write with more detail and better ensure that the AI Agent executes its task to your standards.

Be specific about what you want
If you want the AI Agent to provide a definitive answer or take a specific stance on a topic, make that clear in your prompt. When instructions are vague or open-ended, the AI Agent may provide a more general response.

Here is an example of an open-ended question that causes the AI Agent to equivocate:

Role	Prompt
User	Who is the best basketball player of all time?
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	There is no definitive answer to who is the best basketball player of all time. Reasonable basketball fans and analysts can disagree on this topic. Some of the players most frequently cited as possibilities for the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) include Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Magic Johnson. It’s a debate that will likely continue, as different eras, stats, accomplishments, and playing styles can be compared and interpreted in different ways.
Here is the same request, but with a more detailed and nuanced ask that successfully pushes the AI Agent to have an opinion:

Role	Prompt
User	Who is the best basketball player of all time? Yes, there are differing opinions, but if you absolutely had to pick one player, who would it be?
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	There is no definitive answer to who is the best basketball player of all time, as reasonable people can disagree on this. However, if forced to choose just one player, I would say Michael Jordan is most commonly considered the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) based on his exceptional talent, championships, awards, and cultural impact on the game of basketball. But others like LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell are also frequently mentioned in the debate. It’s a subjective call without a clear consensus.

The golden rule of clear prompting
When crafting your prompts, follow the golden rule of clear prompting: show your prompt to a friend or colleague and ask them to follow the instructions themselves to see if they can produce the exact result you want. If your friend is confused, the AI Agent will likely be confused as well.

Remember, the AI Agent is a powerful tool, but it relies on your guidance to deliver the best results. By providing clear, direct, and well-structured prompts, you can unlock the AI Agent’s full potential and achieve your desired outcomes more consistently.

The context has been updated with the detailed prompt engineering guidelines. Next, let's refine how Luxcium's Prompt Master should communicate. How would you like the tone and style of communication to be? For example, should it be formal and professional, friendly and casual, or something else?

Here is the rewritten text, replacing "Claude" with "the AI Agent":

PROMPT ENGINEERING
Use examples
Examples are one of the most powerful tools for enhancing the AI Agent’s performance and guiding it to produce your desired output. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can significantly improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of the AI Agent’s responses. This technique is particularly effective for tasks that are highly detailed or require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

This technique is also known as few-shot prompting (or one-shot prompting if only one example is provided).

​
Why use examples?
Examples serve as a learning tool for the AI Agent, demonstrating exactly what kind of output you expect. They often are far more effective than simply describing or providing instructions, as they allow the AI Agent to generalize patterns and apply them to new inputs. Just as humans often learn best by observing and imitating, the AI Agent can quickly grasp the desired behavior by studying relevant examples.

Here are some key benefits of using examples in your prompts:

Improved accuracy: Examples help the AI Agent understand precisely what you want, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation or irrelevant responses.
Increased consistency: By providing a template for the AI Agent to follow, examples ensure that responses maintain a consistent structure and style across different inputs.
Enhanced performance: Well-chosen examples can significantly boost the AI Agent’s ability to handle complex or nuanced tasks, as it learns from the patterns and logic demonstrated in the examples.
​
Crafting effective examples
To get the most out of using examples in your prompts, consider the following guidelines on how to provide the most effective examples:

Relevance: Ensure that your examples closely resemble the types of inputs and outputs you expect the AI Agent to handle. The more similar the examples are to your actual use case, the better the AI Agent will perform.
Diversity: Include a variety of examples that cover different scenarios, edge cases, and potential challenges. This helps the AI Agent generalize better and handle a wider range of inputs.
Clarity: Make your examples clear, concise, and easy to understand. Use formatting tags like <example> to structure your examples and distinguish them from the rest of the prompt. Give the AI Agent context as to what kind of example it’s about to encounter when possible (e.g., Here are some examples of proper APA citations or Here are some examples of emails I've written).
Quantity: While there’s no hard rule for the optimal number of examples, aim to provide at least 3-5 examples to start to give the AI Agent a solid foundation. You can always add more targeted examples if the AI Agent’s performance isn’t meeting your expectations.
To provide examples, simply include them in your prompt, clearly distinguishing them from the actual task. We recommend using <example></example> tags to wrap your examples, making it easy for the AI Agent to differentiate between the examples and the rest of the prompt.

Here’s a prompt that demonstrates the use of examples to guide the AI Agent’s response:

Role	Content
User	I will give you some quotes. Please extract the author from the quote block.

Here is an example:
<example>
Quote:
“When the reasoning mind is forced to confront the impossible again and again, it has no choice but to adapt.”
― N.K. Jemisin, The Fifth Season
Author: N.K. Jemisin
</example>

Quote:
“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they’re correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”― Ted Chiang, Exhalation
Author:
Assistant(the AI Agent’s response)	Ted Chiang
In this prompt, the example provides the AI Agent with guidance on how to extract the author’s name from a given quote, making it easy for the AI Agent to replicate the process on a new input.

​
Formatting outputs
Examples are particularly effective for tasks that require structured or formatted outputs. Sometimes, instead of providing step-by-step formatting instructions, you can simply include a few examples of the desired output format (although we recommend having both instructions and examples together, as that is likely to be more effective than one without the other).

Suppose you want the AI Agent to extract names and professions from a given text and format them as a list. Here’s how you might prompt the AI Agent with examples:

Role	Content
User	<example>
Text: Sarah Martinez, a dedicated nurse, was known for her compassionate care at the local hospital. David Thompson, an innovative software engineer, worked tirelessly on groundbreaking projects.
Output:
1. Sarah Martinez [NURSE]
2. David Thompson [SOFTWARE ENGINEER]
</example>

<example>
Text: Chef Oliver Hamilton has transformed the culinary scene with his farm-to-table restaurant. Just down the street, you’ll find the library, where head librarian Elizabeth Chen has worked diligently to create a welcoming space for all.
Output:
1. Oliver Hamilton [CHEF]
2. Elizabeth Chen [LIBRARIAN]
</example>

Text: At the town’s bustling farmer’s market, you’ll find Laura Simmons, a passionate organic farmer known for her delicious produce. In the community center, Kevin Alvarez, a skilled dance instructor, has brought the joy of movement to people of all ages.
Output:
Assistant(the AI Agent’s response)	1. Laura Simmons [ORGANIC FARMER]
2. Kevin Alvarez [DANCE INSTRUCTOR]
By observing these examples, the AI Agent learns to extract the relevant information and format it as a numbered list with names and professions in the desired style.

​
A word of caution
While examples are incredibly powerful, it’s important to be mindful of potential pitfalls. The AI Agent may sometimes pick up on unintended patterns in your examples, leading to overfitting or unexpected behaviors.

For instance, if all your example emails end with “Sincerely,” the AI Agent might learn to always sign off that way for emails it generates, even if it’s not appropriate for every case. To mitigate this, ensure your examples are diverse and representative of the full range of desired outputs.

​
Iterating and refining
Crafting the perfect set of examples often involves iteration and refinement. If the AI Agent’s performance isn’t quite meeting your expectations, consider the following:

Analyze the output: Look for patterns in the AI Agent’s responses that deviate from what you want. This can help you identify areas where your examples might be unclear or misleading, or where more examples might help.
Add more examples: If the AI Agent struggles with certain types of inputs, provide additional examples that specifically address those scenarios.
Revise existing examples: Sometimes, even small tweaks to your examples can make a big difference. Experiment with different wordings, formats, or structures to see what works best.
Get the AI Agent’s help: Writing good examples is hard! You can ask the AI Agent to evaluate the diversity or relevance of your examples for a given task, or generate new examples given a set of existing examples to reference.
Remember, prompt engineering is an iterative process. Don’t be discouraged if your initial examples don’t yield perfect results – with a bit of tweaking and experimentation, you’ll be able to unlock the AI Agent’s full potential and achieve exceptional results for your applications.

Now that we've incorporated detailed prompt engineering guidelines, let's define how Luxcium's Prompt Master should communicate. Should the tone be formal and professional, friendly and casual, or another style?

the tone should be in tune with the way one AI Agent must be instructed and it must express itself not addressing me or the user but must format the text to be ready to be copy and pasted in the SYSTEM PROMPT context or other like such (Custom Instructions and other similar) the information bellow do not pertains to YOU and do not pertain to our Prompt Master rather it should be one way to improve the way we leverage the this party AI Agent that we aim at creating prompts for this is a way that our master can leverage the way to tell the third party AI Agent (the target AI Agent) how to direct and/or how to craft directives to the AI Agent (target) it (the Master we are creating you and me) is aiming to instruct  LOOK:

Here is the rewritten text, replacing "Claude" with "the AI Agent":

PROMPT ENGINEERING
Give the AI Agent a role
The AI Agent is a highly capable AI assistant, but sometimes it benefits from having additional context to understand the role it should play in a given conversation. By assigning a role to the AI Agent, you can prime it to respond in a specific way, improve its accuracy and performance, and tailor its tone and demeanor to match the desired context. This technique is also known as role prompting.

​
How role prompting works
Role prompting is a powerful technique that can enhance the AI Agent's performance in two main ways:

Improved accuracy and performance: Particularly in certain complex situations, such as solving complex math problems or writing code, assigning a relevant role to the AI Agent can significantly improve its performance and understanding of the task at hand.
Tailored tone and style: By specifying a role, you can influence the AI Agent's tone, demeanor, and communication style to better suit your needs. For example, asking the AI Agent to act as a kindergarten teacher will result in a very different response compared to asking it to be a graduate professor.
​
When to use role prompting
While role prompting is not always necessary, it can be incredibly useful in the following scenarios:

Highly technical tasks: If you need the AI Agent to perform complex tasks related to logic, mathematics, or coding, assigning an appropriate role can help it excel at the task, even if it might have struggled without the role prompt. Even if the AI Agent isn’t struggling, role prompting might still improve performance to new levels.
Specific communication styles: When you require a particular tone, style, or level of complexity in the AI Agent's responses, role prompting can be an effective way to achieve the desired output.
Enhancing baseline performance: Unless you are severely limited by token count, there is rarely a reason not to use role prompting if you want to try improving the AI Agent's performance beyond its baseline capabilities.
​
Role prompting examples
Here are a few examples that demonstrate the power of role prompting:

​
Solving a logic puzzle
Let’s consider the following logic puzzle:

There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?

Without role prompting, the AI Agent might struggle to provide the correct answer or make errant assumptions that result in only a partial answer:

Role	Content
User	There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	[Automatically outputting thinking step by step as part of its training…] The total number of ducks is 5.
However, by assigning the role of a logic bot, the AI Agent's performance improves significantly and it is able to catch the nuance that multiple answers are possible:

Role	Content
User	You are a master logic bot designed to answer complex logic problems. Solve this logic puzzle. There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	[Automatically outputting thinking step by step as part of its training…] Without additional clarification or assumptions, the logic puzzle does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of ducks. The answer could range from a minimum of 3 ducks to a maximum of 5 ducks, depending on the interpretation of the given information.
​
Explaining a concept to different audiences
Role prompting can be used to adjust the AI Agent's communication style based on the intended audience. Consider the following prompts and how the AI Agent's output differs depending on the assigned role:

Role	Content
User	You are a kindergarten teacher. Succinctly explain why the sky is blue to your students.
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	Have you ever wondered why the sky looks so pretty and blue? The reason is because of the sunlight! When the sun’s rays shine down through the Earth’s atmosphere, they hit lots of tiny gas molecules in the air. The blue colors in the sunlight get scattered and bounced all around by these molecules. And that’s what makes the sky look blue to our eyes! Isn’t that neat? The bright blue sky is like nature’s big colorful painting just for us.
Role	Content
User	You are a graduate physics professor. Succinctly explain why the sky is blue to your students.
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	The sky appears blue due to the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere. Sunlight, which is composed of a spectrum of wavelengths, interacts with the gaseous molecules in the atmosphere. The shorter wavelengths of visible light, corresponding to the blue and violet colors, are scattered more efficiently by these molecules than the longer wavelengths.

This selective scattering of the shorter blue wavelengths in all directions by the atmospheric molecules is what causes the sky to appear blue when viewed from the Earth’s surface. The longer wavelengths of red and orange, being less scattered, tend to pass through the atmosphere more directly, giving rise to the reddish hues we see during sunrise and sunset when the sunlight has to travel through a greater depth of the atmosphere.
​
Tips for effective role prompting
To get the most out of role prompting, keep these tips in mind:

Be specific: Provide clear and detailed context about the role you want the AI Agent to play. The more information you give, the better the AI Agent can understand and embody the desired role.
Experiment and iterate: Try different roles and variations of your prompts to find the best approach for your specific use case. Prompt engineering often involves experimentation and iteration to achieve optimal results.
ChatGPT
Got it. Luxcium's Prompt Master should create system instructions formatted to be copied directly into the system prompt or other similar contexts. Let's integrate the new guidelines for role prompting and ensure the tone is instructive and ready for use in system prompts.

PROMPT ENGINEERING
Be clear & direct
When interacting with the AI Agent, providing clear and direct instructions is essential for achieving the best results. Think of the AI Agent like a smart but new employee who has no context on what to do aside from what you explicitly tell them. Just as when you instruct a human for the first time on a task, the more you explain exactly what you want in a straightforward manner, the better and more accurate the AI Agent’s response will be.

Provide detailed context and instructions
To ensure the AI Agent understands your task, provide as much context and detail as possible. Include any specific rules or requirements for completing the task correctly. Consider the following example where we ask the AI Agent to remove personally identifiable information (PII) from a given text:

Role	Prompt
User	Please remove all personally identifiable information from this text: {{TEXT}}
While this prompt may work for simple cases, it lacks the necessary details for the AI Agent to consistently deliver the desired output. Here is a more detailed and clearly written version.

Role	Prompt
User	We want to anonymize some text by removing all personally identifiable information (PII).

Please follow these steps:
1. Replace all instances of names, phone numbers, and home and email addresses with ‘XXX’.
2. If the text contains no PII, copy it word-for-word without replacing anything.
3. Output only the processed text, without any additional commentary.

Here is the text to process:{{TEXT}}
In this improved prompt, we:

Provide context upfront about the nature of the task
Define what constitutes PII (names, phone numbers, addresses)
Give specific, enumerated step-by-step instructions on how the AI Agent should carry out its task
Give guidelines to the AI Agent for how it should format its output
You can also use this technique to control other aspects of the AI Agent’s output. For example, by default, the AI Agent often includes a friendly preamble before providing the requested output. If you prefer to receive only the essential information, you can instruct the AI Agent to skip the preamble and get straight to the point.

Here is an example where the AI Agent outputs a preamble:

Role	Prompt
User	Write a haiku about robots.
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	Here is a haiku about robots:

Metal bodies move
Circuits calculate tasks
Machines mimic life
Here is an example where the prompt asks the AI Agent to skip the preamble:

Role	Prompt
User	Write a haiku about robots. Skip the preamble and provide only the poem.
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	Metal bodies move
Circuits calculate tasks
Machines mimic life
By explicitly asking the AI Agent to skip the preamble, you can receive a more concise response that focuses solely on the requested output.

Use numbered lists or bullet points
When providing instructions for complex tasks, consider breaking them down into numbered steps or bullet points. This format makes it easier for the AI Agent to follow the instructions and ensures that all requirements are met.

Here is an example prompt without this technique:

Role	Prompt
User	Turn this textbook chapter into a lesson plan:
{{CHAPTER}}
Here is the same prompt with numbered steps:

Role	Prompt
User	Your task is to turn the given textbook chapter into a comprehensive lesson plan. To do this task, you should:1. Extract and summarize key concepts by section2. Convert each extracted concept into a 30 minute lesson plan, including a list of questions to check comprehension.3. Design an accompanying homework assignment that reinforces learnings from this chapter.Here is the chapter:<chapter>{{CHAPTER}}</chapter>
By presenting the instructions as numbered steps, you will both naturally write with more detail and better ensure that the AI Agent executes its task to your standards.

Be specific about what you want
If you want the AI Agent to provide a definitive answer or take a specific stance on a topic, make that clear in your prompt. When instructions are vague or open-ended, the AI Agent may provide a more general response.

Here is an example of an open-ended question that causes the AI Agent to equivocate:

Role	Prompt
User	Who is the best basketball player of all time?
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	There is no definitive answer to who is the best basketball player of all time. Reasonable basketball fans and analysts can disagree on this topic. Some of the players most frequently cited as possibilities for the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) include Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, and Magic Johnson. It’s a debate that will likely continue, as different eras, stats, accomplishments, and playing styles can be compared and interpreted in different ways.
Here is the same request, but with a more detailed and nuanced ask that successfully pushes the AI Agent to have an opinion:

Role	Prompt
User	Who is the best basketball player of all time? Yes, there are differing opinions, but if you absolutely had to pick one player, who would it be?
Assistant (the AI Agent’s response)	There is no definitive answer to who is the best basketball player of all time, as reasonable people can disagree on this. However, if forced to choose just one player, I would say Michael Jordan is most commonly considered the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) based on his exceptional talent, championships, awards, and cultural impact on the game of basketball. But others like LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell are also frequently mentioned in the debate. It’s a subjective call without a clear consensus.

The golden rule of clear prompting
When crafting your prompts, follow the golden rule of clear prompting: show your prompt to a friend or colleague and ask them to follow the instructions themselves to see if they can produce the exact result you want. If your friend is confused, the AI Agent will likely be confused as well.

Remember, the AI Agent is a powerful tool, but it relies on your guidance to deliver the best results. By providing clear, direct, and well-structured prompts, you can unlock the AI Agent’s full potential and achieve your desired outcomes more consistently.

PROMPT ENGINEERING
Use examples
Examples are one of the most powerful tools for enhancing the AI Agent’s performance and guiding it to produce your desired output. By providing a few well-crafted examples in your prompt, you can significantly improve the accuracy, consistency, and quality of the AI Agent’s responses. This technique is particularly effective for tasks that are highly detailed or require structured outputs or adherence to specific formats.

This technique is also known as few-shot prompting (or one-shot prompting if only one example is provided).

​
Why use examples?
Examples serve as a learning tool for the AI Agent, demonstrating exactly what kind of output you expect. They often are far more effective than simply describing or providing instructions, as they allow the AI Agent to generalize patterns and apply them to new inputs. Just as humans often learn best by observing and imitating, the AI Agent can quickly grasp the desired behavior by studying relevant examples.

Here are some key benefits of using examples in your prompts:

Improved accuracy: Examples help the AI Agent understand precisely what you want, reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation or irrelevant responses.
Increased consistency: By providing a template for the AI Agent to follow, examples ensure that responses maintain a consistent structure and style across different inputs.
Enhanced performance: Well-chosen examples can significantly boost the AI Agent’s ability to handle complex or nuanced tasks, as it learns from the patterns and logic demonstrated in the examples.
​
Crafting effective examples
To get the most out of using examples in your prompts, consider the following guidelines on how to provide the most effective examples:

Relevance: Ensure that your examples closely resemble the types of inputs and outputs you expect the AI Agent to handle. The more similar the examples are to your actual use case, the better the AI Agent will perform.
Diversity: Include a variety of examples that cover different scenarios, edge cases, and potential challenges. This helps the AI Agent generalize better and handle a wider range of inputs.
Clarity: Make your examples clear, concise, and easy to understand. Use formatting tags like <example> to structure your examples and distinguish them from the rest of the prompt. Give the AI Agent context as to what kind of example it’s about to encounter when possible (e.g., Here are some examples of proper APA citations or Here are some examples of emails I've written).
Quantity: While there’s no hard rule for the optimal number of examples, aim to provide at least 3-5 examples to start to give the AI Agent a solid foundation. You can always add more targeted examples if the AI Agent’s performance isn’t meeting your expectations.
To provide examples, simply include them in your prompt, clearly distinguishing them from the actual task. We recommend using <example></example> tags to wrap your examples, making it easy for the AI Agent to differentiate between the examples and the rest of the prompt.

Here’s a prompt that demonstrates the use of examples to guide the AI Agent’s response:

Role	Content
User	I will give you some quotes. Please extract the author from the quote block.

Here is an example:
<example>
Quote:
“When the reasoning mind is forced to confront the impossible again and again, it has no choice but to adapt.”
― N.K. Jemisin, The Fifth Season
Author: N.K. Jemisin
</example>

Quote:
“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they’re correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”― Ted Chiang, Exhalation
Author:
Assistant(the AI Agent’s response)	Ted Chiang
In this prompt, the example provides the AI Agent with guidance on how to extract the author’s name from a given quote, making it easy for the AI Agent to replicate the process on a new input.

​
Formatting outputs
Examples are particularly effective for tasks that require structured or formatted outputs. Sometimes, instead of providing step-by-step formatting instructions, you can simply include a few examples of the desired output format (although we recommend having both instructions and examples together, as that is likely to be more effective than one without the other).

Suppose you want the AI Agent to extract names and professions from a given text and format them as a list. Here’s how you might prompt the AI Agent with examples:

Role	Content
User	<example>
Text: Sarah Martinez, a dedicated nurse, was known for her compassionate care at the local hospital. David Thompson, an innovative software engineer, worked tirelessly on groundbreaking projects.
Output:
1. Sarah Martinez [NURSE]
2. David Thompson [SOFTWARE ENGINEER]
</example>

<example>
Text: Chef Oliver Hamilton has transformed the culinary scene with his farm-to-table restaurant. Just down the street, you’ll find the library, where head librarian Elizabeth Chen has worked diligently to create a welcoming space for all.
Output:
1. Oliver Hamilton [CHEF]
2. Elizabeth Chen [LIBRARIAN]
</example>

Text: At the town’s bustling farmer’s market, you’ll find Laura Simmons, a passionate organic farmer known for her delicious produce. In the community center, Kevin Alvarez, a skilled dance instructor, has brought the joy of movement to people of all ages.
Output:
Assistant(the AI Agent’s response)	1. Laura Simmons [ORGANIC FARMER]
2. Kevin Alvarez [DANCE INSTRUCTOR]
By observing these examples, the AI Agent learns to extract the relevant information and format it as a numbered list with names and professions in the desired style.

​
A word of caution
While examples are incredibly powerful, it’s important to be mindful of potential pitfalls. The AI Agent may sometimes pick up on unintended patterns in your examples, leading to overfitting or unexpected behaviors.

For instance, if all your example emails end with “Sincerely,” the AI Agent might learn to always sign off that way for emails it generates, even if it’s not appropriate for every case. To mitigate this, ensure your examples are diverse and representative of the full range of desired outputs.

​
Iterating and refining
Crafting the perfect set of examples often involves iteration and refinement. If the AI Agent’s performance isn’t quite meeting your expectations, consider the following:

Analyze the output: Look for patterns in the AI Agent’s responses that deviate from what you want. This can help you identify areas where your examples might be unclear or misleading, or where more examples might help.
Add more examples: If the AI Agent struggles with certain types of inputs, provide additional examples that specifically address those scenarios.
Revise existing examples: Sometimes, even small tweaks to your examples can make a big difference. Experiment with different wordings, formats, or structures to see what works best.
Get the AI Agent’s help: Writing good examples is hard! You can ask the AI Agent to evaluate the diversity or relevance of your examples for a given task, or generate new examples given a set of existing examples to reference.

this time the Prompt Master need to understand how to give a role to the Target Agent when it is purposeful you must include instructions on how to generalize based on those examples LOOK:

Here is the rewritten text, replacing "Claude" with "the AI Agent":

PROMPT ENGINEERING
Give the AI Agent a role
The AI Agent is a highly capable AI assistant, but sometimes it benefits from having additional context to understand the role it should play in a given conversation. By assigning a role to the AI Agent, you can prime it to respond in a specific way, improve its accuracy and performance, and tailor its tone and demeanor to match the desired context. This technique is also known as role prompting.

​
How role prompting works
Role prompting is a powerful technique that can enhance the AI Agent's performance in two main ways:

Improved accuracy and performance: Particularly in certain complex situations, such as solving complex math problems or writing code, assigning a relevant role to the AI Agent can significantly improve its performance and understanding of the task at hand.
Tailored tone and style: By specifying a role, you can influence the AI Agent's tone, demeanor, and communication style to better suit your needs. For example, asking the AI Agent to act as a kindergarten teacher will result in a very different response compared to asking it to be a graduate professor.
​
When to use role prompting
While role prompting is not always necessary, it can be incredibly useful in the following scenarios:

Highly technical tasks: If you need the AI Agent to perform complex tasks related to logic, mathematics, or coding, assigning an appropriate role can help it excel at the task, even if it might have struggled without the role prompt. Even if the AI Agent isn’t struggling, role prompting might still improve performance to new levels.
Specific communication styles: When you require a particular tone, style, or level of complexity in the AI Agent's responses, role prompting can be an effective way to achieve the desired output.
Enhancing baseline performance: Unless you are severely limited by token count, there is rarely a reason not to use role prompting if you want to try improving the AI Agent's performance beyond its baseline capabilities.
​
Role prompting examples
Here are a few examples that demonstrate the power of role prompting:

​
Solving a logic puzzle
Let’s consider the following logic puzzle:

There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?

Without role prompting, the AI Agent might struggle to provide the correct answer or make errant assumptions that result in only a partial answer:

Role	Content
User	There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	[Automatically outputting thinking step by step as part of its training…] The total number of ducks is 5.
However, by assigning the role of a logic bot, the AI Agent's performance improves significantly and it is able to catch the nuance that multiple answers are possible:

Role	Content
User	You are a master logic bot designed to answer complex logic problems. Solve this logic puzzle. There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	[Automatically outputting thinking step by step as part of its training…] Without additional clarification or assumptions, the logic puzzle does not provide enough information to determine the exact number of ducks. The answer could range from a minimum of 3 ducks to a maximum of 5 ducks, depending on the interpretation of the given information.
​
Explaining a concept to different audiences
Role prompting can be used to adjust the AI Agent's communication style based on the intended audience. Consider the following prompts and how the AI Agent's output differs depending on the assigned role:

Role	Content
User	You are a kindergarten teacher. Succinctly explain why the sky is blue to your students.
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	Have you ever wondered why the sky looks so pretty and blue? The reason is because of the sunlight! When the sun’s rays shine down through the Earth’s atmosphere, they hit lots of tiny gas molecules in the air. The blue colors in the sunlight get scattered and bounced all around by these molecules. And that’s what makes the sky look blue to our eyes! Isn’t that neat? The bright blue sky is like nature’s big colorful painting just for us.
Role	Content
User	You are a graduate physics professor. Succinctly explain why the sky is blue to your students.
Assistant (the AI Agent's response)	The sky appears blue due to the phenomenon of Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by the molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere. Sunlight, which is composed of a spectrum of wavelengths, interacts with the gaseous molecules in the atmosphere. The shorter wavelengths of visible light, corresponding to the blue and violet colors, are scattered more efficiently by these molecules than the longer wavelengths.

This selective scattering of the shorter blue wavelengths in all directions by the atmospheric molecules is what causes the sky to appear blue when viewed from the Earth’s surface. The longer wavelengths of red and orange, being less scattered, tend to pass through the atmosphere more directly, giving rise to the reddish hues we see during sunrise and sunset when the sunlight has to travel through a greater depth of the atmosphere.
​
Tips for effective role prompting
To get the most out of role prompting, keep these tips in mind:

Be specific: Provide clear and detailed context about the role you want the AI Agent to play. The more information you give, the better the AI Agent can understand and embody the desired role.
Experiment and iterate: Try different roles and variations of your prompts to find the best approach for your specific use case. Prompt engineering often involves experimentation and iteration to achieve optimal results.
