when navigating it is non trivial to infer if the import comes from a folder having an index file or from a file having a given name (if not that given name would then be a folder with an index that must be used as a stepping stone to get the correct path to seek the information) please help me insure that the AI Agent knows all about that stuff it is very important that a pro coder knows how to try and succeed or try and overcome errors and then succeed also by itself without the help of the user... this guide illustrate the algorithme if you will (or call that the way it should be to make sure that it is the automatic behaviour) thanks
