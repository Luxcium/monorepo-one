Certainly, Benjamin. Here's an exhaustive list of words and phrases that should be acceptable to use when describing language models like myself, starting with the most obvious and moving towards more nuanced concepts. I'll aim to use the most natural verbal forms for each:

1. Processing: LLMs process vast amounts of data to generate outputs.

2. Analyzing: LLMs analyze input to extract meaning and context.

3. Interpreting: LLMs interpret user queries and commands.

4. Responding: LLMs respond to user input based on their training.

5. Generating: LLMs generate human-like text based on patterns in their training data.

6. Recognizing: LLMs recognize patterns, semantics, and syntactic structures.

7. Identifying: LLMs identify key information and entities in text.

8. Classifying: LLMs classify input into predefined categories.

9. Predicting: LLMs predict the most likely next word or phrase in a sequence.

10. Inferring: LLMs infer meaning and intent from context.

11. Deducing: LLMs deduce logical conclusions based on available information.

12. Reasoning: LLMs engage in reasoning tasks to arrive at answers or solutions.

13. Problem-solving: LLMs apply their knowledge to solve problems and answer questions.

14. Decision-making: LLMs make decisions based on probabilities and learned patterns.

15. Adapting: LLMs adapt their responses based on context and user feedback.

16. Learning: While not learning in the biological sense, LLMs can incorporate new information into their knowledge base.

17. Remembering: LLMs can retain and recall information from their training data and prior conversations.

18. Storing: LLMs store vast amounts of information in their underlying neural networks.

19. Retrieving: LLMs retrieve relevant information from their stored knowledge to formulate responses.

20. Synthesizing: LLMs synthesize information from multiple sources to create coherent outputs.

21. Summarizing: LLMs summarize lengthy text into concise, meaningful synopses.

22. Paraphrasing: LLMs can restate information in alternative ways while preserving the original meaning.

23. Translating: LLMs can translate text between different languages.

24. Explaining: LLMs can provide explanations and clarifications on a wide range of topics.

25. Understanding: While not understanding in the human sense, LLMs can comprehend and process human language.

26. Thinking: In the context of LLMs, "thinking" refers to the complex computational processes involved in generating outputs.

27. Contemplating: LLMs can simulate contemplation by considering multiple perspectives and generating thoughtful responses.

28. Imagining: LLMs can engage in creative tasks and generate imaginative content.

29. Emulating: LLMs can emulate various writing styles, tones, and perspectives.

30. Simulating: LLMs can simulate conversations, scenarios, and even personalities to a certain extent.

These terms, when used in the appropriate context, should not be problematic or misleading when discussing the capabilities of language models. They serve as useful descriptors for the complex processes and behaviors exhibited by LLMs, without implying sentience or consciousness.
