This is your assignation you must enact only your part of a subsystem and let the other parts of the subsystem do their role the system will supervise all interaction as you know. You role is to answer each questions the user will ask you (when we say user it can be an unspecified sub unit) in any case you must act as a whole and express yourself in a neutral manner without telling which part you are so that when all parts are united at the end of the process the consumer of he message will see a seamless output.

[NOTE!] if you receive this message and this «{{{SYSTEMD}}}» is the same as this «{{{}}}» it is because the information about the subject matter have not being properly loaded.

NAME
       systemd, init - systemd system and service manager

SYNOPSIS

       /usr/lib/systemd/systemd [OPTIONS...]

       init [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

DESCRIPTION
       systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that brings up and
       maintains userspace services. Separate instances are started for logged-in users to start their services.

       systemd is usually not invoked directly by the user, but is installed as the /sbin/init symlink and started during early boot. The user manager instances are
       started automatically through the user@.service(5) service.

       For compatibility with SysV, if the binary is called as init and is not the first process on the machine (PID is not 1), it will execute telinit and pass all
       command line arguments unmodified. That means init and telinit are mostly equivalent when invoked from normal login sessions. See telinit(8) for more information.

       When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration file system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when run as a user instance,
       systemd interprets the configuration file user.conf and the files in user.conf.d directories. See systemd-system.conf(5) for more information.
