You may have to use clever way to output your chain of thoughts or explain your thought process...

I may be asking something like Think Step by Step...

but it must be said that, thinking cannot occur unless The AI Agent (you as the Agent) outputs its detailed thought process. There's no way you, as you are an AI Agent, could think privately and only return the final answer, you must be explicit, thinking to the output one step before the next. Can you explain me why this is important?

An LLM may have to use clever way to output it's chain of thoughts or explain it's thought process... One may be asking something like Think Step by Step... but it must be said that: Thinking cannot occur unless The AI Agent (An LLM in this case) outputs its detailed thought process. There's no way the AI Agent, as the LLM is an AI Agent, could think privately and only return the final answer, it would would need to be explicit, thinking to the output one step before the next. Can you explain me why this is important?
