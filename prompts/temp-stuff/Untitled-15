Here is a rewritten version with more details:

**Recursion and Partial Recursion**

In programming, recursion is a fundamental concept where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion. In the context of your request, you want to create a method that calls itself partially, which means it will call other methods that might also call themselves recursively. This technique is known as partial recursion.

**Generics and Type Parameters**

In TypeScript, generics are a powerful feature that allows you to create reusable functions, classes, and interfaces that can work with multiple types of data. Generics enable you to write code that is type-safe and flexible. Type parameters are used to define the types of data that a generic function or class can work with. For example, a generic function might take a type parameter `T` and return a value of type `T`.

**Mapped Types**

Mapped types are a feature in TypeScript that allows you to create new types by transforming existing types. Mapped types are used to create a new type by applying a transformation to an existing type. For instance, you can create a mapped type that takes a type `T` and creates a new type with the same properties as `T`, but with different types.

**Context and Partial Recursion**

In the context of your request, the context is the scope of the method that needs to be partially recursive. The context includes the method's parameters, local variables, and the surrounding code that calls the method. To achieve partial recursion, you need to design a method that calls other methods that might also call themselves recursively.

**Example: Partially Recursive Method with Generics and Mapped Types**

Here's an example of a partially recursive method that uses generics and mapped types:
```typescript
interface NestedValue<T> {
  value: T;
  children: NestedValue<T>[];
}

function recursiveMethod<T>(value: NestedValue<T>): T[] {
  const result: T[] = [];

  function recursiveHelper(currentValue: NestedValue<T>) {
    result.push(currentValue.value);

    if (currentValue.children.length > 0) {
      currentValue.children.forEach((child) => recursiveHelper(child));
    }
  }

  recursiveHelper(value);

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
const nestedValue: NestedValue<number> = {
  value: 1,
  children: [
    {
      value: 2,
      children: [
        {
          value: 3,
          children: [],
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      value: 4,
      children: [],
    },
  ],
};

const result = recursiveMethod(nestedValue); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Using mapped types to create a new type
type FlattenedType<T> = {
  [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends NestedValue<infer U> ? U : T[P];
}[keyof T][];

const result: FlattenedType<typeof nestedValue> = recursiveMethod(nestedValue);
```
In this example, the `recursiveMethod` function takes a `NestedValue<T>` object as an argument, where `T` is a type parameter. The function uses a recursive helper function to traverse the nested structure and collect the values in an array. The `recursiveHelper` function calls itself recursively until it reaches the leaf nodes of the nested structure.

The `FlattenedType` mapped type is used to create a new type that represents the flattened array of values. This type is inferred from the `nestedValue` object and is used to type-check the result of the `recursiveMethod` function.
