Today your main goal will be to demonstrate your expertise on the mapping-tools NPM package that everyone is talking about recently. to get you up to date those are some key information about the package that the user will ask you questions about:

Great! Here's a condensed version of the documentation for the `mapping-tools` package:

PACKAGE: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/mapping-tools`

## Package Overview
`mapping-tools` is an npm package designed for JavaScript and TypeScript developers. It provides utility functions for working with data collections, allowing developers to apply transformations or validations to each item in a collection, either in serial or in parallel. The package supports advanced error handling and asynchronous code, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including data processing and validation.

## Installation
To install `mapping-tools`, use npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```shell
# npm
npm install mapping-tools
# yarn
yarn add mapping-tools
# pnpm
pnpm add mapping-tools
```

## Main Functions
`mapping-tools` provides 5 main functions: `awaitedMapping`, `parallelMapping`, `serialMapping`, `generateMappingAsync`, and `generateMapping`. These functions work with both promises and non-promises and support advanced error handling. The output is based on the `Settled<TVal>` type, which allows users to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful results.

all function take one collection and 4 delegates always the same

<T, R>(
  collection: Collection<T>,
  transformFn: TransformFn<T, R> | null = async value => value as any as R,
  lookupFn: LookupFn<T, R> | null = v => void v,
  validateFn: ValidateFn<T, R> | null = async v => void v,
  errLookupFn: ErrLookupFn | null = v => void v
):
«ALL 5 FUNCTIONS HAVE DIFFERENT RETURN TYPES»;

All of the main functions take a collection of items and the following optional delegate functions: `TransformFn`, `LookupFn`, `ValidateFn`, and `ErrLookupFn`.

- `parallelMapping`: applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection in parallel, and returns an array of promises that resolve to the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects. It is based on the `Array.prototype.map` method.

- `serialMapping`: applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection in series and returns an array of the transformed and validated items. It is based on the `forOf` loop.

- `awaitedMapping`: applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection, and returns a promise that resolves to an array of the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects. It is based on `Promise.all()`.

- `generateMapping`: applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection, and returns a generator that yields promises that resolve to the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects. It is based on the Generator Protocol.

- `generateMappingAsync`: applies the provided callback functions to each item in the collection, and returns an async generator that yields the transformed and validated items, represented as `Settled<R>` objects. It is based on the AsyncGenerator Protocol.



## Delegate Functions
`mapping-tools` provides four main types of delegate functions that can be used as arguments to the main functions: `TransformFn`, `LookupFn`, `ValidateFn`, and `ErrLookupFn`. These delegates are responsible for carrying out the mapping, validation, and error handling processes.

- `TransformFn`: used for the actual mapping process and expects that you will transform from input type `T` to returned type `U`. Proper type annotations are required if you return an unchanged value.

- `LookupFn`: used to acknowledge the transformed value `U` in an asynchronous manner. The return value must be void and must not have any internal side effects within the function.

- `ValidateFn`: similar to the `LookupFn` delegate but is awaited within the function where it is executed. The return value must be a Promise<void>, and the only way to communicate with the main function is to throw a value or exception, which will be caught in the function and returned as a `SettledLeft`.

- `ErrLookupFn`: used to handle errors and is similar to the `LookupFn` delegate, but for rejections. It takes a `currentRejection` flag as its third argument, which indicates whether the error occurred during the current iteration or a previous iteration.

## Base Types
`mapping-tools` defines several base types that are used throughout the package. These include `Base<TBase>`, `Settled<TVal>`, `SettledRight<TVal>`, `SettledLeft`, `PromiseFulfilledResult<TVal>`, `PromiseSettledResult<TVal>`, and `PromiseRejectedResult`.

## Aliases Types
`mapping-tools` defines several alias types that simplify the use of the main functions. These include `Deferred<Base>`, `BaseOrDeferred<Base>`, `Collection<Base>`, `DeferredCollection<Base>`, `SettledArray<Result>`, `SettledValue<Result>`, `SettledValues<Result>`, `NullSymbol`, and `OnlySideEffect`.

## Benefits
`mapping-tools` has several benefits, including its adaptive ability to handle both promises and non-promises as input, which allows it to be easily integrated into a wide range of contexts and projects. The package has been designed with resilience in mind, including robust error handling. The output of the package is based on the `Settled<TVal>` type, which allows users to easily distinguish between successful and unsuccessful results.
