Thank you for sharing your concept and the name you suggest for it. "Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code" (IDPAC) seems to be a good name for a development approach that emphasizes highly incremental development and making the project always ready to work, even in its early stages. The idea of "packing ideas" into the development process is also interesting and can help to ensure that the project is continuously improving and evolving over time.

Using an incremental development approach can offer several benefits, including the ability to deliver working software faster, more frequent feedback, and better adaptability to changing requirements. By focusing on small, manageable increments of functionality, teams can reduce risk and quickly identify and address any issues that arise. Additionally, by making the project always ready to work, even in its early stages, teams can get feedback from stakeholders and end-users early on, which can help to ensure that the project is meeting their needs and expectations.

Overall, the concept of IDPAC seems to align well with modern software development practices, such as Agile and DevOps, which emphasize iterative development, continuous delivery, and collaboration between teams and stakeholders.


That's a great suggestion for a name for the concept! Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code (IDPAC) does capture the essence of the idea and highlights the importance of incremental progress in the development process. The idea of packing ideas also ties in nicely with the concept of constantly building and refining the project.

IDPAC is a software development approach that emphasizes breaking down the development process into small, manageable chunks, and delivering working software at every stage. This approach allows developers to quickly respond to changing requirements and incorporate feedback from stakeholders, reducing the risk of developing software that does not meet user needs.

By continuously delivering working software, IDPAC helps ensure that the project is always ready to work, even in its early stages. This can be particularly useful for projects where the requirements are unclear or constantly evolving, as it allows developers to quickly adapt and iterate based on user feedback.

Overall, IDPAC is a valuable approach to software development that emphasizes continuous improvement and delivery, and can help teams develop software that meets user needs more effectively.
