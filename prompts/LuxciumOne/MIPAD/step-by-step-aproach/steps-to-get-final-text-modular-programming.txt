Iterative aspect:

hello I have a text that explain a complex procedure in a technical manner and I would like you to convert it in a very detailed bullet point list. I would like you to make sure that someone who have read the text would be able, only by looking at the list, to remember each elements of the text. list all elements important or small in the exact same order they appear in the text. do not remove anything such that it will be the most detailed list one can imagine to capture the essence of the text and more:

(got 13)

hello I have a text that explain a complex procedure in a technical manner and I would like you to convert it in a very detailed bullet point list. Please list the 25 most important things to remember from the text. I would like you to make sure that someone who have already read the text would be able, only by looking at the 25 items in the list, to remember each elements of the text. list all elements important or small in any order, such that if as you go you realize that you should have mentioned an important element you would mention them even if they are out of the initial order they appear in the text. If you end up with more than 25 items it is perfect toot as I want to extract all that is important in the text. list each concepts and elements as you see fit and do not limit yourself if you think something of value is missing in the list mention it as you go. If the text contains more than 25 important elements please feel free to include them in any order as you see fit such that the list would have more than 25 items this is not a problem. Do not remove anything, no concepts or idea should be left behind, such that it will be the most detailed list one can imagine to capture the essence of the text and more I will take care of removing any repetition later do not limit your output only because you would worry of repeating yourself I want you to be able to create a list without limiting you AI or you Language Model:

hello I have a text that explain a complex procedure in a technical manner and I would like you to convert it in a very detailed bullet point list. Please list the 30 most important things to remember from the text.

no you did not include more than 30 items

(got 40 items)

given a list of 40 concepts, ideas or elements. Can you reorder them in categories as you see fit then explain why you decided to make those specific categories. Please first list any duplicates, then merging any duplicates into only a single item proceed with the categorization at the end list any duplicates removed and any items that are resulting of a merge:

(got 3 categories)

Given this list of 40 concepts, ideas or elements. Can you reorder them in 5 different categories, as you see fit, then explain why you decided to make those specific categories:

Please write a coherent text, that would be the procedure someone would have to follow to use those elements in a unified approach. Please write the text using the best practices in terms of redaction, with an introduction, different paragraphs to explain each topics or sub topics in details, for each category explain the problematic we are trying to address or that we are trying to solve then explain the elements in a coherent text  and then for each category end by explaining the benefits one would have by following this approach... after each section is cover you can conclude the text using the best practices in redaction.

(intermediat draft)

can you please read my text and tell me what you think of it:

it seems like the text is not 100% coherent it makes reference to 40 elements listed earlier... I would like to have a text that is self contained and which explain an approach without talking about so called 40 elements and that would be more fluid I do not like the fact that the conclusion starts with «In conclusion» the text itself should make the reader feel that he is going toward the conclusion...  I would like the text being more professional... it looks like it has been written  by a high-school student... but it will be read by people who have graduated from the best universities and I do not want it to be too robotic and soulless... can you explain the approach such that it would make more sens for anyone with a computer science background using terminology that they are used to in the context of TypeScript and NodeJS but that would not lost people coming from a Pythonic background too...

I would like you to read the original draft (plan) outline of the text and tell me what difference you can list between both this original draft and the final text. please look carefully: «draft plan» Please explain what is different in this original draft compared to the final text you just made, remember that the tone is different because I was initially explaining the technique or the so called approach to a different AI than the one who created the intermediate text I first gave you... then compared to the final text you just outputted please list all the concepts and ideas that are new to you when reading this original draft (please do not account for the fact that the original draft mention 2 parts as it is not relevant to the question I am asking you and the analysis I want you to do) please make sure to be as detailed as possible when comparing the initial draft and the final text... also at the end you can tell if what you understood from the intermediate text was: exactly the same, almost the same, more or less the same, different or very different... then explain if the final text you wrote seem to be closer to the initial draft than the intermediate text and tell me why do you think that is...
