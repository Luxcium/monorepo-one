I would like you to read the original draft (plan) outline of the text (below) and tell me what difference you can list between both this original draft and the final text (mentioned earlier). please look carefully:

«draft plan»

 Please explain what is different in this original draft compared to the final text (that you just reviewed for  me), remember that the tone is different because I was initially explaining the technique or the so called approach to a different AI than the one who created the final text I first gave you... I want you to analyze then compared to the final text you just reviewed: please list all the concepts and ideas that are new to you when reading this original draft (please do not account for the fact that the original draft mention 2 parts as it is not relevant to the question I am asking you and the analysis I want you to do) please make sure to be as detailed as possible when comparing the initial draft and the final text... also at the end you can tell if what you understood from the text you just reviewed was: exactly the same, almost the same, more or less the same, different or very different... compared with the initial draft and tell me why do you think that is...
