The other part of the approche is compatible with the fist one but to me it is bot completely different an also related to what I want to do so far... I want to make the project always ready to work... it is a strange approach that I would love you to find a name for either using already existing similar approaches or if it is new then create a meaningful appellation for the concept... I want to lets say start with a file that would be mostly empty and then lets say I would want the project to always be in the completed state (it is difficult to explain because I want to work on a tool capable of accomplishing some tasks and obviously it is weird to me to say it would be working even before it is capable to accomplish the task, so I will be so happy when you will be reexplaining me that technique to better understand what I am trying to explain, for now lets say it is working meaning that it is not crashing... if the first half of the approach was the one putting the emphasis on the best practices in terms of interface creation and good documentation practices... this other half of the approach will be the one that will put a high emphasis on testing the project (using jest for the typescript part and well known best practices for the python part of the project) also because the project is highly modular it should be really really easy to implement a 100% coverage right at the early beginning. despite the fact that the testing approach is one of the very important elements of this section... it is not what I want you to remember... the same way that the first half was not specifically about the documentation this second half is not about the testing... so what is it all about well I already said the main part I want the project to be highly incremental starting with a few no-ops and implementing them as we go then adding a few more no-ops and implementing them (implementing meaning to create the corresponding operation) I said it was both different and similar both related and unrelated to the first half but the way how it is related is that it push the concept of modularity so far that eve inside of the module (or functions) being created it is accomplished small pieces at a time pushing te concept of black boxing to each line of code even pushing the modularization to each variable each function calls and so on... the reason why I came up with this approach was because my interactions with the model (especially the ChatGPT-3.5 and lower) it was giving me a lot and lot of code and I ended up having many problems and then asking question and corrections was complicated because it was moving the conversation out of scope of the initial code and making it way too complicated... if instead the function is first a no op that do not change anything it means that the code is still working exactly as before but conceptually one piece is added it is not doing concretely anything yet but conceptually we can already see what it will be doing maybe it will parse a path or maybe it will do this or that also because we will want to make it do something it implies indirectly that it will have to only accomplish a small piece at a time... this is the essence of the first half of the concept that was asking for hyper modularisation... it also implies something very powerful, strong and amazing...  the code is first written as pseudo code but it is not any random pseudo code it is pseudo code that is also valid typescript code or valid python code or whatever... so this second half is the nature of what I would temporarily call highly incremental... or highly recursive... the fact that I have been explaining myself for so long without having a working project was so frustrating... now at the minute 0 I already have a working project I would have one file with an empty main function of with a main function and a console log   and I would call the main function and already I would have a finished project I would push that on GitHub and call it a day... (well a minute... the minute 0 haha.. ok maybe you can not laugh but I did for you and me)... to be serious then I would say I want to modify an image doing this or that to the image... it would imply to have a path so we would create the part of the code that get the string of the path (instead of the complicated implementation that ChatGPT-3.5 was giving me and that was not working and that I would have to argue with him and then he would misunderstand and then the frustration is so hard on me)  this is why this new approach (or this half of the overall paradigm) will be way less stressful... an analogy come to my mind... if you drive during the night from Montréal to Toronto the old approach was to have all the detail of each point of the road at any given time in focus and in scope with me and my AI Assistant... when in the real life you only need to see as far as your head lights can shine and you will make it to Toronto from Montréal even in the darkest night ever... same with our project my AI Assistant (and also myself) do not need to know the complete path.. we do not even need a GPS in this metaphor as long as you know how to read the signs along the road and that you have an overall idea of where you want to go... you see this is what I want to do because I am tired of the complicated arguments with my AI Assistant I now just want to focus one the next 100 meters  or so and this will be enough... again please we will do the same exercise for only this second half of the desired workflow please can you again do the 3 phase analysis of that second part (do not forget to first think of the appellation of this concept or paradigm and explain if it is a well know practice or if not invent a name or find an appellation for it... then also in the context of naming thing then explain if parts of the concepts are well known or similar to well known approaches I know it is not exactly test driven development but it could still be one of the similar concepts that  you could name... after this additional part of analysis then you will be able to do the 3 part analysis we did earlier and then you will be able to do the 1) Ingestion phase: summarize what I said so far in this second half specifically then 2) assessment phase: reexplain what I said so far  in this second part, say it in your own words, expanding the explanation based on your wider understanding and in the context of what I have explained so far in this second half tell what it means to you, explain this context and 3) Inference phase: express what you think could be done to put in practice this paradigm or those concepts that where explained in this last section, explain what would be the best approach and how all that would be influencing the work that we will be doing together explain what you know already about that and as I mentioned also tell about similar approaches that could be source of inspiration. Tell what could be the usual way people would understand such concept... then thinking about the first half (the black box and modular approach) explain what you think about how both are complementary and at the same time quite different in term of concepts...

Thank you for explaining the second half of your approach. Based on your description, it seems like you are proposing an iterative and incremental development approach that emphasizes modularity and testing. This approach involves starting with a file that is mostly empty and gradually building up the project by implementing small pieces of functionality (no-ops) and testing them as you go. The goal is to have a project that is always in a working state and can be easily modified or extended.

In terms of naming this approach, it could be called "Iterative Modular Development" or "Incremental Modular Testing" to reflect the emphasis on modularity and testing. It's not a new concept, as it is similar to test-driven development, where tests are written first and then code is implemented to pass those tests. However, your approach places a greater emphasis on modularization and breaking down the implementation into small pieces.

To summarize, this approach involves:

Starting with a file that is mostly empty
Implementing small pieces of functionality (no-ops) one at a time
Testing each piece of functionality as it is implemented to ensure that the project remains in a working state
Continuing this process until the project is complete
In terms of assessment, this approach can be very effective in ensuring that the project remains manageable and easy to modify or extend. By breaking the implementation down into small pieces, it is easier to ensure that each piece works as intended and that the project as a whole remains in a working state. The emphasis on testing also helps to catch any issues early on and ensures that the project is robust and reliable.

To put this approach into practice, we would need to ensure that the project is designed in a modular way so that it can be broken down into small pieces. We would also need to set up a testing framework, such as Jest for TypeScript, to test each piece of functionality as it is implemented. The iterative and incremental nature of this approach means that it can be more time-consuming than other approaches, but it can also lead to a more reliable and robust project in the long run.

In terms of how this approach relates to the first half of your paradigm (the black box and modular approach), both approaches are complementary in that they both emphasize modularity and breaking down the implementation into small pieces. However, the first half focuses on designing interfaces and documenting them well, while the second half focuses on implementation and testing. Together, these approaches can help to ensure that the project is well-designed, well-documented, and reliable.
