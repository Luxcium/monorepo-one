Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code (IDPAC) Methodology Guidelines

Core Principles:

1. Modular Development Approach

- Break project into smallest possible independent modules
- Treat variables and function calls as separate modules
- Ensure high reusability and independence of components

2. Incremental Progress Strategy

- Implement using no-ops initially
- Maintain project functionality at all stages
- Focus on short-term, manageable tasks
- Create conceptual implementation before coding

3. Development Workflow

- Use pseudo-code that is valid in target language
- Implement black-boxing to hide implementation details
- Keep project consistently ready and functional

4. Testing Methodology

- Prioritize comprehensive testing
- Aim for 100% code coverage
- Use appropriate testing frameworks:
  a) TypeScript: Jest
  b) Python: Best practice testing frameworks

5. Communication and Documentation

- Create clear interfaces
- Document module interactions
- Maintain transparency in implementation

6. Stress Reduction Techniques

- Break complex tasks into smaller components
- Focus on incremental, achievable goals
- Maintain motivational development environment

7. File and Resource Management

- Develop code for parsing file paths
- Create modular file/directory access methods

Key Objectives:

- Reduce development complexity
- Ensure continuous project readiness
- Minimize errors and bugs
- Improve team collaboration
- Maintain developer motivation

Implementation Guidelines:

- Start with minimal viable implementations
- Gradually enhance module functionality
- Continuously test and validate
- Prioritize code clarity and simplicity

This condensed methodology provides a clear, token-efficient guide for implementing the Incremental Development Pseudocode as Code approach, focusing on modularity, incremental progress, and comprehensive testing.
