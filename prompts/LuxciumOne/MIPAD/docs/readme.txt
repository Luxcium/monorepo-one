# Modular Incremental Programming and Development (MIPAD): A New Approach to Software Development

Software development is a complex and challenging task that requires a
systematic approach to ensure high-quality code and efficient
workflow. In this context, the Modular Incremental Programming and
Development (MIPAD) approach provides a new perspective on software
development, emphasizing the importance of black boxing, incremental
progress, and collaboration with an AI assistant to achieve optimal
results.

## Embracing a Modular and Incremental Methodology

As a developer working with an AI assistant, it's important to adopt
an approach that emphasizes both incremental progress and interface
creation/documentation. The concept of hyper modular code using black
boxes is highly effective in achieving this goal. In this approach,
individual modules or components are treated as self-contained units
with well-defined inputs and outputs, enabling developers to optimize
the interfaces between components without needing to understand
specific implementation details. This approach is highly modular and
scalable, allowing for improved development and debugging, as well as
greater flexibility in system design.

## Prioritizing Code Quality through Testing and Documentation

In addition to black boxing, incremental progress is key to keeping
stress and frustration levels low during development. By breaking down
complex systems into smaller, more manageable components, developers
can focus on achievable tasks that push the concept of modularity to
each line of code. The code is first written as valid pseudo code
before being implemented, and the modularization is pushed so far that
even variables and function calls are modularized. This highly
incremental and recursive approach puts a high emphasis on testing and
achieving 100% coverage using Jest for TypeScript and best practices
for Python.

It's important to note that while interface creation and documentation
are crucial to the project, they should come last in the development
process. The AI assistant should be in the state of mind required to
accomplish tasks in a highly incremental and modularized manner,
understanding the complete path of the project while focusing on the
next 100 meters in an efficient manner. By working together as a team
with the AI assistant, the developer can achieve the best results in a
highly optimized workflow, fostering a productive and harmonious
working environment.
