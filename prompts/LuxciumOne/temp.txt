Great! Here's a condensed version of the information you provided:

## Package Overview
Mapping Tools is an npm package that provides utility functions for working with data collections. It allows developers to apply transformations or validations to each item in a collection, either in serial or in parallel. The package supports advanced error handling and asynchronous code, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including data processing and validation.

## Installation
To install Mapping Tools, use npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```shell
# npm
npm install mapping-tools
# yarn
yarn add mapping-tools
# pnpm
pnpm add mapping-tools
```

## Main Functions
Mapping Tools provides 5 main functions: `awaitedMapping`, `parallelMapping`, `serialMapping`, `generateMappingAsync`, and `generateMapping`. These functions work with both promises and non-promises and support advanced error handling. The output is based on the `Settled<TVal>` type, which allows users to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful results.

## Delegate Functions
Mapping Tools provides four main types of delegate functions that can be used as arguments to the main functions: `TransformFn`, `LookupFn`, `ValidateFn`, and `ErrLookupFn`. These delegates are responsible for carrying out the mapping, validation, and error handling processes.

## Base Types
Mapping Tools defines several base types, including `Base<T>`, `Settled<TVal>`, `SettledRight<TVal>`, `SettledLeft`, `PromiseFulfilledResult<TVal>`, `PromiseSettledResult<TVal>`, and `PromiseRejectedResult`. These types allow for robust error handling and tracking of the transformation process.

## Benefits
The package's adaptive ability to handle both promises and non-promises as input, which allows it to be easily integrated into a wide range of contexts and projects. The package has been designed with resilience in mind, including robust error handling. The output of the package is based on the `Settled<TVal>` type, which allows users to easily distinguish between successful and unsuccessful results.
