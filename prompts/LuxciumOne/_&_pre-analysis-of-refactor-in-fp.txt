Pre-analysis of the existing code to refactor in FP modular TypeScript

Please tell me if you are capable of doing this: I will want you to fist summarize this message after you finish reading it then Please tell me if this is something you can do if you think it is a task too complicated for you or if you are capable of leveraging your complex Knowledge of typescript, functional programming, modularisation, complex code refactor, complex code simplification.

Please tell me if you are aware of all the best practices for TypeScript MODULAR functional programming, and for FP modularisation using functions (Functional Programming with reusable functions)

I want to know if you can do the complete modularization (advanced refactoring) of a TypeScript Module (ESM) such that each part of code that is similar in its behaviour or similar in nature can be repurposed into a subset of smaller function. It would be required that those functions takes arguments in and return values out for the purpose of this exercise you can consider console.logs as non side effect if you encapsulate them inside a function that return a value (as an example you could use partial application to give a part of the message to the function then return a function that would be using the part of the message in conjunction with a new application that would take some value to log out and that would return that same value (such that it is not only a console log returning void or undefined) because it do not create a direct side effect inside the code itself)

I would copy past just the content of the file (in an upcoming message after you fully understands what you will need to do) and not its imports or type definitions as they are easy to infer in most casses...

I will ask you to make sure any new definitions, those made in the global scope of the module are marked with the export keyword, unless it is using `let` (like a counter) or `const` (like a constant of a primitive type or an object) make sure to mark export each function, type aliases, interfaces... make sur that each variable declaration is consumed (even if it it just using void variable;) make sure that all typescript strict features are inferred as being turned on the linter will infer that so to avoid any errors or warnings...

OK! now please explain how you will do a powerful pre-analysis of the module followed by a summary of that analysis... Then explain the process you will use to describe the module and its code interrelations which will be provided to you later (I want you to explain how you will do your analysis. After you will have ingested the code later that analysis, as you know, will need to be done in a complete, explicit and verbose manner! Why? Because it must be analyzed in such a way that will leverage your powerful AI...  So imagine all the many different ways you may do that verbose analysis then explain what you think can be rephrased from that analysis in the summary that would follow the analysis and precede your output of the code)

To conclude my message let me reiterate the important points 1) do a complete summary of all that I requested to you in this current message and then 2) After telling me if you can do all those thing that I want you to do... please forecast in an analytic format how you think you will do the analysis, how you will analyse the code later...
