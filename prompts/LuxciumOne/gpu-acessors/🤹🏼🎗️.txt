i want to have some GPU (least expensive) and do some local usage (on my computer local usage is remote to the GPU) it would need to somehow connect to some sort of whatever… send the data compute on GPU and then send back the results back to me and it must not be charging me for any moment before computing and after completing…


this is not a straightforward question for an LLM based AI Agent therefore you must absolutely split it in smaller chunks to think about what each of these things would imply and then split them think about what they each do imply and then keep it conceptually higher level of abstraction so that you can think about even more particular requirements for each sub stages and then just keep splitting them out until you get a rough idea of what you want to do then summarize the plan and then explain what each parts would require in planning…


including enumeration of possible candidates for each parts and explicit selection of the best case per subsets and the repeat the rest of the process (you can choose to do all of these stages internally while you are working on your project and outline only parts of the thought process doing what is needed to leverage your actual processing of the plan and how you can use all these elements together to create an effective plan for the optimal explanation for the concepts at each stages and how they would need their own structure planning the requirements for intermediate stages maximize the overall explanation of concrete solutions and how they should be implemented one with each other to ensure that i have a local development environment and transparency of each remote requests and minimal overhead… with the costs of intermediary solutions (those that i called nodules are essentially just to maintain the highest possible availability and readiness and they can easily hold (or not depending on the task) some data if and only if it is expensive to make ingress or outgress or other factors such as the computational resources that are required to achieve the GPU acquisition and release… in any case it would also be possible to « turn on » this intermediate stage with time out on some idle time… and then the cpu time would be cheaper and closer to the GPU if you have to go in this direction (i might be naive or uninformed about anything so don’t worry if you can find a better solution here but if you consider then it would probably be worth the effort or if not then you might just have a better idea or better solution) please think it through and let’s see what you make out about all of this!!!
