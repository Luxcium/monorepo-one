5. Optimization Strategies

Contributing Factors:
	•	Resource Scheduling:
	•	Preemptive scheduling for low-priority tasks.
	•	Spot instance allocation for transient workloads.
	•	Workload Distribution:
	•	Leverage GPUs with heterogeneous task batching.
	•	Usage Monitoring:
	•	Real-time dashboards for utilization trends.
	•	Cost Allocation:
