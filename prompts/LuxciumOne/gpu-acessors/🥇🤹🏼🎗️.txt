	•	Data Transmission: Implement lossless compression.
	•	Monitoring: Use Prometheus for detailed tracking and automation.
	•	Resource Management: Use NVIDIA’s containerized solutions for resource scheduling.

4. Operational Workflow

Subtasks:
	•	Resource Initialization:
	•	Spin up GPU resources on demand using APIs like AWS Lambda’s Elastic GPUs.
	•	Data Transfer:
	•	Transfer data over a secure, fast protocol like gRPC.
	•	Minimize costs by batching data.
	•	Computation Execution:
	•	Use frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch for workload distribution.
	•	Results Retrieval:
	•	Fetch computed results and post-process locally to save costs.

	•	Leverage Lambda GPUs for on-demand execution and gRPC for secure data transfer.

5. Optimization Strategies

Subtasks:
	•	Resource Scheduling:
	•	Use Kubernetes with GPU-aware scheduling.
	•	Workload Distribution:
	•	Implement load balancing with tools like Traefik.
	•	Usage Monitoring:
	•	Real-time dashboards via Grafana.
	•	Cost Allocation:
	•	Use predictive scaling to minimize idle costs.
