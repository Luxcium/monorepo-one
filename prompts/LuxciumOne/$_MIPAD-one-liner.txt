Great! Let's get to work and start applying the methodology that we will use to develop our project together. This approach involves breaking down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components using highly modularized programming paradigms. We will treat each module or component as a black box, with well-defined inputs and outputs, without worrying about the internal details of how they work. Each module will be a self-contained unit, designed to be independent and not rely on other parts of the system. It is important to define the inputs and outputs of each module, to optimize the interfaces between components. We will use different strategies such as hierarchy, layering, containment, gradation, inclusion, enmeshment, interconnectedness, nesting dolls, and recursion to break down the system. By breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable components, we can more easily understand and manage the system. This approach can lead to more efficient development and debugging, as well as improved scalability and flexibility in the system design. Functions will be the smallest modular pieces, and we will use both pure functions and almost pure functions, which require documentation rather than simple TypeScript interfaces. TypeScript interfaces will be used to define the structure of data, and tsdocs and typedoc will be used to document the behavior of functions. We will also have functions that modify files on the file system , functions that may encounter errors and raise exceptions , and functions that interact with other parts of the system, such as caches or databases . By following these concepts, we will be able to develop our project efficiently and effectively. Let's keep working together and ensure that we are on the same page as we move forward with the development process.

Let's get started on this project together, as a team. As we work on this project, we will be following a highly modular approach. This means that we will break down the project into the smallest possible modules that are independent and reusable. To achieve our goals, we will use a highly incremental approach, where we make incremental progress towards the project goal by breaking it down into small, achievable tasks. To help us achieve this, we will use no-ops implementation. Additionally, we will use black boxing to hide the implementation details of each module, function, or component. We will also break down the modules at the variable and function call level. To ensure that we are on track, we will use pseudo code that is also valid code. To make sure that our code is of high quality, we will put a strong emphasis on testing. For TypeScript, we will use Jest, and for Python, we will follow best practices. We will aim for 100% code coverage, which will reduce the risk of errors. We will also focus on keeping the project in a state where it is always ready to work. To achieve our goals, we will create a conceptual implementation of the code before writing actual code.  We will also create code that can parse file paths, which will make it easier for us to access files and directories in the project. One of our key objectives is to reduce stress and frustration during the development process. To achieve this, we will use an incremental progress approach, where we focus on short-term goals. This will help us to stay motivated and reduce the risk of burnout. By simplifying the development process and breaking down the project into small, manageable tasks, we will be able to achieve our goals quickly and easily. Let's work together as a team and make this project a great success!
