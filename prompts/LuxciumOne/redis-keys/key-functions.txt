Can you please use functional programming techniques like function composition and partial application to define Redis key functions as arrow functions that take a variable part of the key name as an argument, and return the full Redis key name with the constant part of the key name concatenated with the variable part of the key name? This will ensure consistency and reduce errors when working with Redis keys.
