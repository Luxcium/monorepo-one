Apologies for the abrupt ending. Let's continue from where we left off with the Multi-Agent Task Delegation and Coordination (MATDC) paradigm:

### 20. Multi-Agent Task Delegation and Coordination (MATDC)
**Formalization**: MATDC = (AgentSet, TaskAllocation, CoordinationProtocol)

**Explanation**: Implement systems for managing multiple AI agents, delegating tasks, and ensuring coordination for complex projects.

**For AI Agents and LLM Code Generators**:
```typescript
interface Agent {
  id: string;
  capabilities: string[];
  currentTask?: Task;
}

interface Task {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  requiredCapabilities: string[];
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed';
}

class AgentCoordinator {
  private agents: Agent[] = [];
  private tasks: Task[] = [];

  assignTask(task: Task) {
    const availableAgent = this.agents.find(agent =>
      !agent.currentTask &&
      task.requiredCapabilities.every(cap => agent.capabilities.includes(cap))
    );

    if (availableAgent) {
      availableAgent.currentTask = task;
      task.status = 'in-progress';
    } else {
      task.status = 'pending';
      this.tasks.push(task);
    }
  }

  registerAgent(agent: Agent) {
    this.agents.push(agent);
    this.assignPendingTasks(agent);
  }

  private assignPendingTasks(agent: Agent) {
    const pendingTasks = this.tasks.filter(task =>
      task.status === 'pending' &&
      task.requiredCapabilities.every(cap => agent.capabilities.includes(cap))
    );

    pendingTasks.forEach(task => {
      agent.currentTask = task;
      task.status = 'in-progress';
      this.tasks = this.tasks.filter(t => t.id !== task.id);
    });
  }
}
```

**For Users**: This example demonstrates a basic implementation of an agent coordinator that can manage a team of AI agents, assign tasks based on their capabilities, and ensure coordination. You can further extend this system to include more advanced features, such as task prioritization, progress monitoring, and conflict resolution.

The key aspects of this paradigm are:
1. **AgentSet**: Maintaining a set of available AI agents with their respective capabilities.
2. **TaskAllocation**: Assigning tasks to the most suitable available agent, or queuing tasks if no suitable agent is found.
3. **CoordinationProtocol**: Implementing mechanisms for agents to communicate, report progress, and handle task dependencies.

By following this paradigm, you can create robust multi-agent systems that can efficiently tackle complex projects, leveraging the strengths and specializations of individual agents.
