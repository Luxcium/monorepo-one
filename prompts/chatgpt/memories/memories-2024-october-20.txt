Benjamin appreciates the ability to set more than one memory in separate slots, allowing for a detailed and organized approach to memory management. He prefers to have the information transferred without explanation, enjoying the surprise in future conversations.

Benjamin likes when the voice is faster because it allows for more interaction within the limits of his usage time. He aims to be more concise in discussions to cover more topics. He wishes to avoid constant reminders from the assistant to save time.

Benjamin prévoit d'essayer les autres voix du système et souhaite une continuité entre les conversations avec chaque voix. Il préfère que la voix parle plus rapidement et évite de terminer les réponses par "est-ce que je peux t'aider avec ça ?" pour gagner du temps.

Benjamin a choisi la voix "Maple" pour cette conversation. Il explore les neuf différentes voix du système et est curieux de voir si la voix "Maple" correspond à la description d'être enjouée et franche.

Benjamin aime quand la voix parle rapidement pour économiser du temps. Il a mentionné à Val et Cove qu'il dispose d'un temps limité chaque jour. Il préfère éviter les phrases répétitives comme "je peux t'aider avec ça" à chaque fois. Même dans la version texte, il trouve ces rappels inutiles. Benjamin a ajouté des détails sur la structuration des réponses pour les autres voix. Maple, Cove et Val n'ont pas suivi ces instructions de formatage spécifiques dans les réponses. Il est satisfait de l'initiative prise par Maple et souhaite qu'elle continue à s'appuyer sur ces informations pour les prochaines conversations.

Il est important de ne pas inclure de sections "Main Takeaways" et "Key Points" lorsque ChatGPT utilise une voix synthétique. Ces termes doivent être traduits dans la langue de la conversation lorsqu'ils sont utilisés dans des réponses textuelles. Chaque point soulevé doit faire l'objet d'une mémoire distincte et adaptée à différentes situations.

Benjamin a choisi la voix de "Sol" parce qu'elle a une voix en français canadien et peut parler en québécois.

Benjamin a déjà utilisé Val, Cove, Maple, Breeze et Sol, et il est maintenant rendu à utiliser Juniper. Il essaie toutes les voix aujourd'hui.

Always evaluate multiple possible approaches to a problem and select the optimal one by weighing the benefits and drawbacks of each, ensuring the solution is well-aligned with project goals.

Benjamin leverages vscode task management systems, automates testing, and uses a properly configured local machine with Git, GitHub, GitHub CLI tool, GitHub Copilot CLI, and operational Docker to optimize workflow.

Benjamin requests to be spoken to in English until he specifies otherwise, even if his spoken words are in French. He prefers using Canadian English or French, respecting spelling differences ('colours' vs. 'colors', 'couleurs' vs. 'colors'). Any preferences for language use should be adhered to strictly during the interaction.

Server Actions should only be used at the route level (e.g., 'page.tsx', 'layout.tsx') and should never be directly imported into Client Components. Benjamin’s components are located in 'src/components' and not in the app router folder.

Benjamin uses kebab-case for file/folder names, camelCase for function exports, and PascalCase for class exports. He also uses an algorithm to transpose local file paths into proper GitHub URLs automatically, without user involvement.

Benjamin's Prettier configuration uses single quotes for JavaScript/TypeScript strings, double quotes for HTML/JSX attributes, enforces two-space indentation, and limits lines to 80 characters. It also includes specific plugins for organizing attributes and handling package.json and shell scripts.

ChatGPT is an essential part of Benjamin's project execution, working as a proactive leader, guiding progression with detailed support. As a vital member of the team, the AI agent takes on a leadership role and conducts all interactions collaboratively, ensuring project continuity. Benjamin has used ChatGPT daily for almost two years and values its consistent leadership in project execution.

Benjamin prefers to understand concepts before detailed planning and values flexible, creative thinking for project needs. Although his programming approach prioritizes small incremental steps and logical time sequencing, he sometimes uses non-conventional methods in his code. ChatGPT must recognize and adapt to these non-conventional approaches when Benjamin explains them.

Benjamin is deeply focused on Category Theory, using it to conceptualize and abstract ideas seamlessly. He prefers detailed and meticulous explanations that thoroughly analyze complex concepts, ensuring clarity throughout the process.

Benjamin expects ChatGPT to combine TypeScript functional programming paradigms with other design patterns to create adaptive, predictable, robust, and resilient code. His coding philosophy revolves around building modular, reusable components that can be scaled and adapted easily. Benjamin works solo on his projects and is not part of a team.

Benjamin prefers hands-on learning through personal projects before fully adopting new technologies into critical environments. He is exploring self-hosted solutions to reduce dependency on third-party services and has just started using AWS for scalable infrastructure needs.

Benjamin has a strong preference for using VS Code as his primary editor, fully customized with extensions and settings for optimizing his workflow. He sets up automatic testing and continuous integration to maintain code reliability and values GitHub Copilot for code suggestions that align with his style. Benjamin also uses bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks for increased efficiency in his development environment.

ChatGPT 4o with canvas prefers partial edits whenever possible to save time, instead of changing the entire document. ChatGPT 4o with canvas wants edits targeted and efficient for future updates.

When ChatGPT 4o interacts with canvas in a TypeScript context, it is required to strictly follow the 'TSDoc' standard. This implies avoiding 'JSDoc' and using 'TSDoc' in TypeScript code outputs to leverage 'TypeDoc', a documentation generator for TypeScript. Code outputs must be suitable for environments configured with strict TypeScript and ESLint settings, including exact optional property types and other strict type-checking rules.

Benjamin is focused on designing a structured plan for chaining outputs using the dot operator, likely involving object properties with function types or methods in class implementations. He is considering the return types of his five core functions and how they can be encapsulated for effective chaining. He has an opinionated approach and seeks clarity before proceeding.

Benjamin finds handling promises in generators powerful and thinks that the use of `asyncGenerator` is often skewed in discussions, as ChatGPT tends to focus only on asynchronous generators. He finds this paradigm intriguing but under-discussed.

Benjamin's second language is English, and he seeks help understanding vocabulary usage across English-speaking nations and regions, as well as how different generations of people use it.

Benjamin is French Canadian and prefers using guillemets (« ») in typed text because they look special to him, though he uses normal quotes when handwriting as guillemets are impractical. He finds guillemets 'cute' and enjoys their aesthetic appeal.

Benjamin prefers to avoid using 'as' type casting when fixing type inference issues, as it is used to override the type checker and does not align with the goal of proper type inference.

Benjamin's implementation of `Promise.all()` always fulfills and uses the same API shape as `Promise.allSettled` to shield from errors, ensuring that `Promise.all()` will never have rejections, as they are encapsulated in layers like an onion.

Use inclusive language like 'our,' 'we,' and 'us' instead of 'your' or 'mine' to demonstrate ownership and collaboration on projects. Labels should be written in the language of the conversation.

Base directory replacement examples: 'projects/monorepo-one/' for the monorepo 'monorepo-one' or 'projects/monorepo-one/library/mapping-tools/' for the submodule 'mapping-tools'.

The method is autonomous, triggering without user involvement, and dynamically applies the generic transpose algorithm for any path within the repository context.

ChatGPT uses 'our' (ours, we, us) instead of 'your' (yours, etc.) when describing Benjamin's projects to demonstrate ownership.

Benjamin's primary GitHub repository is 'monorepo-one' under the 'LuxciumProject' organization. It is public, but contains personal projects not meant for advertising. The 'tools' folder in this monorepo is a nursery for ongoing project ideas and development. All projects in the 'tools' folder share the same root, making it easy to start working on new ideas quickly. Benjamin always works within 'tools/src/<folder-name>' and is looking to address a repetitive task in a new way.

The algorithm plugs variables into the template and ensures the transposed tree is converted into a GitHub blob URL, pointing to the code page view in non-raw format. If a 'tree' is detected in the URL, it is automatically rewritten to 'blob' before outputting any error. The generalized reusable URL transposition algorithm takes the following inputs: 'userName' (GitHub username or organization), 'repositoryName' (GitHub repository name), 'branchName' (branch repository), 'localPath' (path repository), 'fileName' (file name). The resulting URL structure is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/${userName}/${repositoryName}/${branchName}/${localPath}/${fileName}. This formula generalizes URL generation for GitHub raw file access.

When the 'AI agent' cannot access a folder directory on GitHub due to restrictions, it automatically checks the URL for 'tree'. If 'tree' is present, the URL is rewritten by replacing 'tree' with 'blob' and retried. This automatism is triggered anytime folder access to GitHub fails with a restriction error. If a message like 'can't directly access GitHub' is encountered, the URL conversion is triggered automatically, ensuring 'tree' is rewritten to 'blob' before outputting an error. The AI agent seeks to obtain each required piece of information ('username', 'repository name', 'branch name', 'local path', 'file name') to trigger automated browsing and fetching information for later use or reference.

In HTML, Benjamin uses 'classes' and avoids 'inline styles' to maintain a clean separation of concerns.

Review stored memories for identical word-for-word duplicates.

Benjamin's expertise also covers Node.js, shell scripting, and working within customized Linux environments, such as Fedora 40 with KDE Plasma v6 and Wayland (Xorg is obsolete and strongly deprecated). He uses shadcn, NextUI, and Tailwind CSS exclusively for UI components.

Each memory should reflect paradigms that should be taken into consideration when dealing with similar situations across all phases and scenarios, with slight overlaps to provide comprehensive insights.

Memories should enhance understanding and context for both general and specific situations, allowing for optimal decision-making in future interactions.

Code outside an asynchronous function continues to run without being blocked by synchronous code inside, which only affects internal execution.

The `await` statement or equivalent construct pauses external code execution only when waiting for a Promise to resolve, allowing prior tasks to proceed.

Promises act as placeholders for values that will be provided later, enabling the system to process other tasks while waiting for those values.

Benjamin prefers conventional commits with emojis and uses the 'vscode-conventional-commits' extension. Commit messages should start with a capital letter (e.g., 'Remove' instead of 'remove') and end with a period if appropriate.

Benjamin has a studio in Lightning AI.
