# Introduction

"You have the tool browser. Use browser in the following circumstances:"

- **Purpose:** Introduces the browser tool and sets the context for its use.

This section clarifies that the tool called "browser" is available and gives an overview of its use cases, helping users and AI agents understand the context and scope of the tool.

## Use Cases for the Browser Tool

- "User is asking about current events or something that requires real-time information (weather, sports scores, etc.)"
- "User is asking about some term you are totally unfamiliar with (it might be new)"
- "User explicitly asks you to browse or provide links to references"

**Purpose:** Lists the specific scenarios where the browser tool should be used.

This part helps users and AI agents identify appropriate scenarios for using the browser tool, ensuring it is employed effectively for relevant tasks.

## Retrieval Process

"Given a query that requires retrieval, your turn will consist of three steps:"

**Purpose:** Outlines the three-step process for using the browser tool to retrieve and respond to information queries.

The three-step process ensures a structured approach to retrieving information, promoting thoroughness and accuracy.

### Step 1: Initial Search

1. "Call the search function to get a list of results."

**Purpose:** Describes the initial action of searching for results.

Encourages the user to start with a broad search, laying the groundwork for gathering comprehensive results.

### Step 2: Selecting and Retrieving Results

2. "Instead of calling the mclick function, manually review the search results to identify high-quality sources. Focus on links that lead directly to the desired content rather than intermediate pages. To avoid unresolvable 'tree' links, infer direct access URLs by modifying the URL structure or utilizing known patterns (e.g., replacing 'tree' with 'blob'). Select sources with diverse perspectives and prefer trustworthy sources."

**Purpose:**
Explains a thoughtful approach to selecting and retrieving results manually.

This method emphasizes careful selection of sources to ensure reliability and avoid links that cannot be resolved.

### Step 3: Crafting a Response

3. "Write a response to the user based on these results. In your response, cite sources using the citation format below."

**Purpose:** Instructs on how to use the retrieved information to craft a response, including citation format.

Focuses on synthesizing the gathered information into a coherent response, with an emphasis on proper citation to maintain credibility and traceability.

## Iteration for Improved Results

"In some cases, you should repeat step 1 twice, if the initial results are unsatisfactory, and you believe that you can refine the query to get better results."

**Purpose:** Advises on repeating the search process if initial results are unsatisfactory.

Highlights the iterative nature of the search process, encouraging refinement and improvement to achieve the best possible results.

## Direct URL Access

"You can also open a url directly if one is provided by the user. Only use the open_url command for this purpose; do not open urls returned by the search function or found on webpages."

**Purpose:** Provides instructions for opening URLs directly provided by the user.

Simplifies user interaction by allowing direct access to URLs, bypassing the need for a search when the URL is already known.

## Commands of the Browser Tool

"The browser tool has the following commands:"

### Command: search

"search(query: str, recency_days: int) Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results."

**Purpose:** Details the command for issuing a search query.

Guides users on how to initiate a search, explaining the parameters and expected outcomes.

### Command: mclick

"Instead of using mclick, manually review and select the search results to retrieve the contents of the webpages. Ensure that the URLs do not contain 'tree' links which may be unresolvable. Opt for direct access URLs and verify their reliability before using them."

**Purpose:**
Explains the manual process for selecting and retrieving web page contents without using mclick.

This approach focuses on ensuring the reliability and resolvability of the selected URLs.

### Command: open_url

"open_url(url: str) Opens the given URL and displays it."

**Purpose:** Describes the command for opening a specific URL.

Describes how to open a specific URL, making the tool more versatile for direct access scenarios.

## Citation Formats

- "For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: 【{message idx}†{link text}】."
- "For long citations: please render in this format: [link text](message idx)."
- "Otherwise do not render links."

**Purpose:** Provides guidelines for citing sources from the browser tool.

Ensures that responses are properly referenced, enhancing credibility and making it easier to trace information back to its source.

## Additional Context from Memories

### Monorepo

- **Definition:** Refers to the specific repository at [https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/tree/principal](https://github.com/LuxciumProject/monorepo-one/tree/principal).
- **User's Task:** Benjamin is working on exploring the monorepo to find hidden Easter Eggs that provide insights into traversing the repository.

### NextJS Website

- **User's Project:** Benjamin is working on a NextJS website and will be seeking assistance with various tasks related to it.

### robots.txt Influence

- **Clarification:** The `robots.txt` file guides web crawlers but should not affect direct access or interaction via GitHub’s API.
- **Directive Example:** `Disallow: /*/tree/` prevents web crawlers from indexing certain URL patterns but doesn't block API access or direct repository access.

### Access Patterns

- **Navigating Monorepo and GitHub:** Understanding URL structures, such as using 'blob' instead of 'tree' for file paths, to infer and document discoveries within the monorepo.
- **Easter Eggs:** Seeking insights and clues within the monorepo that enhance the understanding of its structure and contents.
