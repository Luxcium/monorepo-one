I am writing an npm package named "Mapping Tools" and need inspiration.
Can you create a fictional npm package documentation for a TypeScript npm package
I want to showcase each best practice used to do a modern readme file
Follow all the convention and requirement for a professional npm package
Describe the package and its features in the introduction
Put emphasize on the structure more than the content
Include all the sections most packages would have
A section that would describe the API
A section that would provided examples of how to use the package
Show example for esm and comonjs
Show the instalation for npm, yarn and pnpm...
Under the title in the header include 1 badge from shields.io
Make the documentation user-friendly with navigation and Table of Contents
If required you can use the [[PLACE HOLDER]] notation.
name the package Mapping Tools (mapping-tools) instead  and use these badges only
I provided a header and footer snipets below
HEADER would look like this please:

# Mapping Tools

FOOTER please end this template with:
