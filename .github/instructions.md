# Code Style Guide for GitHub Copilot

## Introduction

This guide helps GitHub Copilot generate code that is easy to read, use, and maintain. By following these rules, the code will be simple, functional, and easy to modify in the future, ensuring long-term quality and understanding across the team.

Markdown best practices suggest avoiding consecutive headers without intervening content. This guide ensures every section is introduced clearly, providing context and maintaining readability.

### Why This Guide?

The goal of this guide is to ensure that generated code is both human-readable and optimized for machine performance. It facilitates collaboration, makes coding simpler, and ensures that best practices are consistently followed.

## Basic Principles

### Keep It Simple

Code should be easy to read and not overly complex. Simple code is easier to debug, test, and maintain.

### Be Consistent

Always follow the same conventions throughout the codebase to ensure ease of understanding and maintenance.

### Separate Concerns

Keep logic, data, and input/output in distinct components to enforce the Single Responsibility Principle and simplify maintenance.

### Ensure Strict Modularity

Maintain strict modularity in every code component by separating logic, data, and I/O operations.

### Use Strict Typing

Leverage TypeScript's strict typing to catch potential issues early and ensure reliability.

### Make Components Small

Each code component should serve a single purpose. This ensures maintainability and simplicity in testing.

### Isolate Infrastructure

Separate core business logic from infrastructure-related code (e.g., databases) to make updates and changes less disruptive.

## Barrel-Only Index Paradigm

### Strict Barrel-Only Policy

`index.ts` files (or any other index files) are **strictly restricted** to serving as **barrel files**. This means they **must only be used for aggregating and re-exporting modules** within the same directory. **Implementation logic is strictly forbidden** in these files. This rule is non-negotiable for all AI Agents and must be enforced consistently.

### Named Exports Only

All exports within `index.ts` files must be **named exports**. Avoid default exports to ensure clarity and facilitate easier refactoring. This prevents naming conflicts and makes imports more predictable.

### Refactor Existing Code

When encountering an `index.ts` file with logic or code beyond aggregation, it **must be refactored** to conform to the Barrel-Only Index Paradigm. The AI Agent must prioritize maintaining separation of concerns and clean code practices.

### Why This Paradigm Matters

This approach ensures a clear separation of concerns and simplifies import statements, promoting a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. It also encapsulates the module's internal structure, making it easier to refactor without disrupting the rest of the codebase.

## Unused Declarations and Variables

### Never Leave Variables or Parameters Dangling

If a variable or parameter is declared but not immediately used, it is essential to handle it properly. **If the value is intended to be consumed later**, make it clear by marking it with an appropriate action such as using `void`, `console.log`, or another method to acknowledge the declaration.

### Mark Unused Variables Explicitly

If a variable or parameter is deliberately **not intended to be used**, mark it with an underscore (`_`) to clearly indicate it is intentionally unused. This ensures that the code remains clean and avoids warnings about unused declarations (e.g., `is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)`).

### Complete Implementation

If a variable or parameter is required but not used in the current implementation, **complete the logic or refactor the code** to make sure it is properly utilized, ensuring the code remains functional and avoids unnecessary declarations.

## Modular Code Design

### Use Interfaces

Define clear boundaries between different parts of the system using interfaces or abstract classes.

### Stay Modular

Separate logic, data handling, and input/output to prevent tight coupling and simplify testing.

### Interchangeable Components

Design parts of the code (e.g., repositories) to be easily replaceable with minimal impact on the domain layer.

### Dependency Injection

Use dependency injection or abstract factory patterns for service instantiation to facilitate unit testing and ensure loose coupling between components.

## Commands and Queries

### Separate Commands from Queries

Commands modify state, while queries retrieve information without causing side effects. This distinction ensures that actions modifying the system are clearly separated from those retrieving data, leading to better maintainability and clarity.

### Example

```typescript
// Command
function addUser(userDetails: UserDetails): void {
  database.insert(userDetails);
}

// Query
function getUserById(userId: string): User | null {
  return database.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`);
}
```

## Naming Conventions

### Variables

Use `camelCase` for variable names (e.g., `userName`, `totalPrice`).

### Classes

Use `PascalCase` for class names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ShoppingCart`).

### Constants

Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants (e.g., `MAX_USERS`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).

### Files

Use `kebab-case` for filenames (e.g., `user-profile.ts`).

### Functions

Function names should be descriptive and use `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateTotal`). Avoid abbreviations for clarity.

### Interfaces and Types

Use `PascalCase` for interfaces and type definitions (e.g., `UserProfile`, `OrderDetails`).

## Code Formatting

### Indentation

Use 2 spaces per indentation level to keep code clean and readable.

### Line Length

Limit lines to 80 characters for better readability, especially on split-screen setups.

### Quotes

Use single quotes for strings, except in JSON, which requires double quotes (e.g., `'hello'` vs. `"{ "key": "value" }"`).

### Semicolons

Always use semicolons to terminate statements, ensuring clarity and avoiding ambiguity.

### Named Function Declarations

Use named functions, especially for exported functions, rather than top-level arrow functions.

### Trailing Commas

Use trailing commas in multiline objects and arrays to simplify diffs.

### Explicit Return Types

Always define return types for functions, particularly in public APIs, to ensure type safety and clarity.

### No Type Assertions

Never use the `as` keyword for type assertions in TypeScript. Type assertions using `as` are strictly forbidden, especially as a shortcut to bypass type issues. Always use proper type definitions to maintain type safety and code robustness.

### No `import *` or `export *`

Always explicitly name imports and exports to prevent namespace pollution and make dependencies clearer.

## Code Organization

### Group Similar Files

Organize files logically in the same folder based on their functionality.

### Single Responsibility Per File

Ensure each file is responsible for a single, well-defined task.

### Logical Modules

Structure the project into clear, cohesive modules with minimal dependencies.

## TypeScript Best Practices

### Prefer `const`

Use `const` for variables that do not need reassignment.

### Avoid `any`

Never use `any` as it undermines type safety and increases the risk of runtime errors. Always use specific, explicit types.

### Interfaces Over Type Assertions

Always prefer interfaces or explicit type definitions instead of using `as` for type assertions. The use of `as` is discouraged because it often hides underlying issues rather than solving them.

### Dependency Injection

Use dependency injection to simplify testing and promote decoupling.

### Node Imports

Use the `node:` prefix exclusively when importing Node.js core modules to clearly distinguish them from user-defined modules.

### Strict Mode

Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` (`"strict": true`) to enforce stronger type checking.

### Named Exports

Use named exports for predictability and ease of refactoring.

## Error Handling

### Structured Error Handling

Use `try/catch` blocks to manage exceptions gracefully, providing helpful messages.

### Custom Error Classes

Create custom error classes for more descriptive and organized error handling.

### Avoid Silent Failures

Always handle errors explicitly to prevent unexpected behavior.

### Control Error Propagation

Ensure errors are properly managed and do not propagate unchecked through the application.

## Writing Quality Code

### Immutability

Avoid mutating objects or arrays. Instead, create new instances to maintain predictable state management.

### Break Large Functions

Decompose large functions into smaller, single-purpose functions to improve readability and testing.

### Command Query Separation (CQS)

Maintain a clear separation between methods that modify state and those that return data.

### Functional Programming

Use functional techniques like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for clean, declarative data manipulation.

### Declarative Code

Focus on what the code should accomplish rather than detailing how to achieve it.

### Input Validation

Always validate function inputs to avoid unexpected errors.

- **Example**: Use `isValidUser(user)` to verify user input.
- **Guard Clause**: Use `if (!input) throw new Error('Invalid input');` to ensure inputs are valid.

### Asynchronous Code

Use `async/await` for handling asynchronous operations, avoiding callback hell.

### Isolate Business Logic

Keep core business logic separate from external systems and infrastructure.

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation

Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.

### Authentication and Authorization

Implement robust authentication mechanisms and enforce authorization checks.

### Data Encryption

Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.

### Secure Dependencies

Regularly update dependencies and monitor for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit`.

### Error Sanitization

Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Provide generic error responses to end-users.

### Example

```typescript
function getUserById(userId: string): User | null {
  if (!isValidUUID(userId)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid user ID.');
  }
  return database.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId]);
}
```

### Use of Localization Libraries

Utilize libraries like i18next or react-intl to manage translations and locale-specific formatting.

### Pluralization and Formatting

Handle pluralization and locale-specific formatting (dates, numbers) appropriately.

### Language Detection

Implement mechanisms to detect and switch languages based on user preferences or browser settings.

### Accessibility in Localization

Ensure that translated content maintains accessibility standards.

## Logging and Monitoring

Ensure all code changes go through pull requests for peer review before merging into the main branch.

### Tagging Releases

Use semantic versioning and tag releases appropriately to track changes and manage deployments.

## Code Review Standards

### Review Criteria

Focus on code readability, adherence to style guidelines, and functional correctness during reviews.

### Constructive Feedback

Provide actionable and respectful feedback to improve code quality without discouraging contributors.

### Automated Checks

Integrate automated linting and testing to assist in the review process and catch common issues early.

### Approval Process

Define clear criteria for approving pull requests, such as requiring a certain number of approvals or passing all tests.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### Automated Testing

Integrate automated tests into the CI pipeline to ensure code integrity with every commit.

### Build Automation

Use CI tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Travis CI to automate build processes.

### Deployment Pipelines

Define clear deployment pipelines for staging and production environments to streamline releases.

### Rollback Strategies

Implement strategies for rolling back deployments in case of failures to minimize downtime.

## Writing Documentation

### Use TSDoc for Inline Comments

Follow the TSDoc standard for documenting TypeScript code, including tags like `@param`, `@returns`, and `@example`.

### Generate Documentation with TypeDoc

Utilize TypeDoc to create comprehensive documentation from TSDoc comments.

### Include Examples and Explanations

Provide examples and explain the rationale behind code implementations.

### Follow Markdown Best Practices

Every header must be followed by at least one explanatory paragraph to ensure clarity and logical flow.

## Code Organization

### Single Responsibility Per File

Ensure each file is responsible for a single, well-defined task.

### Group Similar Files

Organize files logically within the same folder based on functionality.

### Include File Paths in Comments

At the top of code blocks, include the filename and relative path as comments for context.

## TypeScript Best Practices

### Enable Strict Mode

Set `"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json` to enforce stronger type checking.

### Prefer `const`

Use `const` for variables that do not require reassignment.

### Avoid `any` Type

Never use `any`; always specify explicit types to maintain type safety.

### Use Node.js Imports Properly

Use the `node:` prefix exclusively when importing Node.js core modules.

## Testing the Code

### Unit Tests

Write tests for each function to ensure correctness.

### Integration Tests

Test how different parts work together.

### High Test Coverage

Keep coverage above 90%, emphasizing automation during code changes.

### Mocking

Use mocks to fake parts of the code during testing.
