## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow the steps below to report it:

1. **Do not open a public issue**: Please do not report security vulnerabilities in public issues. This helps prevent the vulnerability from being exploited before it can be addressed.

2. **Contact us directly**: Send an email to our security team at [security@luxcium.com](mailto:security@luxcium.com) with the following details:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any potential impact or severity of the vulnerability
   - Any additional information that may help us understand and address the issue

3. **Provide a proof of concept**: If possible, include a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability. This helps us verify and understand the issue more quickly.

4. **Coordinate disclosure**: We will work with you to understand the issue and develop a fix. We may ask you to keep the details of the vulnerability confidential until we have released a patch.
