# Working Notes for the project

Here are some notes that AI Agents have made while working on the project. These notes are meant to be a reference for the AI Agents ongoing efforts as to keep a record of the work done and the work that needs to be done. AI Agents are encouraged to add to these notes as they see fit, but hopefully meticulously keeping trac as to what was planed and what has been completed. These are meant to be internal to the project and are not meant to be shared with the consumers of the service.

## Roadmap for the project

1. Create a basic image processing pipeline that can take an image and apply a filter to it.
2. Create a generic typescrip wraper for the python script that can be reused all over in the project.
3. Create a service that can take an image and extract the metadata from it, passing it with next stage of the pipeline.
    - All file metadata like file size, file type, etc.
    - Image intrinsic metadata like exif, etc.
    - Image processed metadata like image size, histogram, etc.

## Progress Tracking

### Completed

- âœ… Initial project structure setup
- âœ… Basic TypeScript configuration and development environment
- âœ… Definition of core interfaces and types
- âœ… Implementation of comprehensive metadata interfaces
- âœ… Added Sharp and UUID dependencies

### In Progress

- ðŸ”„ Implementing metadata extraction service
  - File system metadata extraction
  - EXIF metadata extraction using Sharp
  - Image analysis (histogram, color statistics)
  - Python integration preparation

### Next Steps

1. ðŸ“‹ Create unit tests for metadata extraction
2. ðŸ“‹ Implement error handling and validation
3. ðŸ“‹ Add logging system for tracking processing steps
4. ðŸ“‹ Create Python scripts for advanced image analysis
5. ðŸ“‹ Implement pipeline stage tracking

### Technical Decisions Made

1. Using Sharp for image processing and basic metadata extraction
2. TypeScript strict mode enabled for type safety
3. Modular architecture for processing steps
4. Conda for Python environment management

## Implementation Details

### Metadata Extraction Components

1. FileSystemAnalyzer
   - Stats from Node.js fs
   - Path information
   - File permissions
   - Timestamps

2. ImageAnalyzer
   - Dimensions
   - Color depth
   - Format
   - DPI
   - Color statistics
   - Histogram analysis

3. ExifExtractor
   - Camera information
   - Capture settings
   - GPS data
   - Software information

4. PythonBridge
   - Advanced image analysis
   - Custom metadata extraction
   - Machine learning features (future)

## Current Sprint Tasks

- [ ] Complete metadata extraction implementation
- [ ] Add validation for extracted metadata
- [ ] Implement metadata persistence
- [ ] Create example usage documentation
