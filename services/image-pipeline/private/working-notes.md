# Working Notes for the project

Here are some notes that AI Agents have made while working on the project. These notes are meant to be a reference for the AI Agents ongoing efforts as to keep a record of the work done and the work that needs to be done. AI Agents are encouraged to add to these notes as they see fit, but hopefully meticulously keeping trac as to what was planed and what has been completed. These are meant to be internal to the project and are not meant to be shared with the consumers of the service.

## Roadmap for the project

1. Create a basic image processing pipeline that can take an image and apply a filter to it.
2. Create a generic typescrip wraper for the python script that can be reused all over in the project.
3. Create a service that can take an image and extract the metadata from it, passing it with next stage of the pipeline.
    - All file metadata like file size, file type, etc.
    - Image intrinsic metadata like exif, etc.
    - Image processed metadata like image size, histogram, etc.

## Progress Tracking

### Completed

- ‚úÖ Initial project structure setup
- ‚úÖ Basic TypeScript configuration and development environment
- ‚úÖ Core type definitions implementation
- ‚úÖ Basic file system metadata extraction
- ‚úÖ Project organization and structure

### Current Implementation State

1. File System Analyzer
   - ‚úÖ Basic file stats (size, dates)
   - ‚úÖ File permissions
   - ‚úÖ Path information

2. Image Analyzer (Not Started)
   - ‚è≥ Dimensions
   - ‚è≥ Color depth
   - ‚è≥ Format detection
   - ‚è≥ Basic image stats

3. EXIF Extractor (Not Started)
   - ‚è≥ Basic EXIF parsing
   - ‚è≥ Camera information
   - ‚è≥ GPS data extraction

### Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. üìã Implement Image Analyzer using Sharp
   - Extract basic image properties (dimensions, format)
   - Calculate color depth and basic stats

2. üìã Add EXIF extraction functionality
   - Integrate with Sharp for EXIF reading
   - Parse and structure EXIF data

3. üìã Implement basic validation
   - Add type guards
   - Validate required fields
   - Add error handling

4. üìã Add unit tests
   - Test file system analyzer
   - Test metadata extraction
   - Test error cases

### Future Enhancements

- Advanced image analysis (histogram, color statistics)
- Python integration for ML features
- Extended metadata persistence
- Pipeline stage tracking

### Technical Decisions Made

1. Using Sharp for image processing and basic metadata extraction
2. TypeScript strict mode enabled for type safety
3. Modular architecture for processing steps
4. Conda for Python environment management
