# Working Notes for the Project

These notes record the progress and outline the next steps for the image-pipeline service.

## Progress Tracking

### Completed

- âœ… Implemented EXIF data extraction using Sharp.
- âœ… Integrated EXIF extraction into the metadata service.
- âœ… Updated `ImageMetadata` interface to include EXIF data.
- âœ… Added unit tests for metadata service and EXIF extraction.
- âœ… Implemented basic image analysis with dimensions and format detection.

### Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. ðŸ“‹ **Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests**
   - [x] Test EXIF data extraction
   - [ ] Test image loading and processing
   - [ ] Test supported file type filtering
   - [ ] Test error cases and edge conditions
   - [ ] Add integration tests for metadata service

2. ðŸ“‹ **Improve Error Handling and Logging**
   - [ ] Add input validation for image buffers
   - [ ] Implement error handling for unsupported EXIF formats
   - [ ] Add detailed error messages for metadata extraction failures
   - [ ] Implement retry mechanism for failed operations

3. ðŸ“‹ **Extend EXIF Extraction Capabilities**
   - [ ] Add GPS data extraction
   - [ ] Support additional EXIF tags
   - [ ] Implement EXIF data validation
   - [ ] Add EXIF writing capabilities

4. ðŸ“‹ **Implement Advanced Image Analysis**
   - [ ] Color histogram generation
   - [ ] Dominant color extraction
   - [ ] Image quality assessment
   - [ ] Format conversion recommendations

### Future Enhancements

- Advanced image analysis (histogram, color statistics).
- Python integration for machine learning features.
- Extended metadata persistence solutions.
- Pipeline stage tracking and monitoring.

## Current Sprint Tasks

- [x] Integrate EXIF extraction into the metadata service
- [x] Implement basic image analysis functionality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for EXIF extraction
- [ ] Write unit tests for EXIF extractor
- [ ] Document EXIF extraction API and examples

## Notes

- Ensure all new code adheres to the code style guide.
- Avoid using `any` types; prefer explicit type definitions.
- Review and refactor any index files to conform to the Barrel-Only Index Paradigm.
- Maintain high test coverage to ensure reliability.

## Implementation Notes

- EXIF extraction uses Sharp's metadata capabilities
- Normalizing EXIF data to ensure consistent types
- Need to handle missing or malformed EXIF data gracefully
- Consider adding validation for supported image formats
- Planning to implement advanced image analysis features in future sprints
