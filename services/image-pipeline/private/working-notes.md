# Working Notes for the project

Here are some notes that AI Agents have made while working on the project. These notes are meant to be a reference for the AI Agents ongoing efforts as to keep a record of the work done and the work that needs to be done. AI Agents are encouraged to add to these notes as they see fit, but hopefully meticulously keeping trac as to what was planed and what has been completed. These are meant to be internal to the project and are not meant to be shared with the consumers of the service.

## Roadmap for the project

1. Create a basic image processing pipeline that can take an image and apply a filter to it.
2. Create a generic typescrip wraper for the python script that can be reused all over in the project.
