# Working Notes for the Project

These notes record the progress and outline the next steps for the image-pipeline service.

## Progress Tracking

### Completed

- âœ… Implemented EXIF data extraction using Sharp.
- âœ… Integrated EXIF extraction into the metadata service.
- âœ… Updated `ImageMetadata` interface to include EXIF data.
- âœ… Added unit tests for metadata service and EXIF extraction.

### Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. ðŸ“‹ **Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests**
   - Test image loading and processing.
   - Test supported file type filtering.
   - Test error cases and edge conditions.

2. ðŸ“‹ **Improve Error Handling and Logging**
   - Provide informative error messages.
   - Handle edge cases gracefully.
   - Convert thrown exceptions into handled errors.

3. ðŸ“‹ **Annotate Code with Meaningful Comments and Tags**
   - Use TSDoc for function documentation.
   - Include maintenance and guidance tags where appropriate.

### Future Enhancements

- Advanced image analysis (histogram, color statistics).
- Python integration for machine learning features.
- Extended metadata persistence solutions.
- Pipeline stage tracking and monitoring.

## Current Sprint Tasks

- [x] Integrate EXIF extraction into the metadata service.
- [ ] Develop comprehensive unit tests for existing modules.
- [ ] Refine error handling mechanisms across the service.
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect recent changes and implementations.

## Notes

- Ensure all new code adheres to the code style guide.
- Avoid using `any` types; prefer explicit type definitions.
- Review and refactor any index files to conform to the Barrel-Only Index Paradigm.
- Maintain high test coverage to ensure reliability.
