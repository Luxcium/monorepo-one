# Working Notes for the Project

These notes record the progress and outline the next steps for the image-pipeline service. They serve as an internal reference to track completed tasks and guide ongoing development.

## Roadmap for the Project

1. **Create a Basic Image Processing Pipeline**
   - Develop functionality to apply filters to images.

2. **Develop a Generic TypeScript Wrapper**
   - Wrap Python scripts for reuse across the project.

3. **Implement Metadata Extraction Service**
   - Extract file metadata (size, type, etc.).
   - Extract image intrinsic metadata (EXIF data).
   - Extract image processed metadata (dimensions, histograms, etc.).

## Progress Tracking

### Completed

- ‚úÖ Initial project structure setup.
- ‚úÖ Basic TypeScript configuration and development environment.
- ‚úÖ Core type definitions implementation.
- ‚úÖ Basic file system metadata extraction.
- ‚úÖ Implemented image loading from directory and single file.
- ‚úÖ Processing images in the main entry point.
- ‚úÖ Filtering supported image types.

### Current Implementation State

1. **File System Analyzer**
   - ‚úÖ Basic file stats (size, dates).
   - ‚úÖ File permissions.
   - ‚úÖ Path information.

2. **Image Analyzer**
   - ‚è≥ Dimensions.
   - ‚è≥ Color depth.
   - ‚è≥ Format detection.
   - ‚è≥ Basic image stats.

3. **EXIF Extractor**
   - ‚è≥ Basic EXIF parsing.
   - ‚è≥ Camera information.
   - ‚è≥ GPS data extraction.

4. **Metadata Service**
   - ‚úÖ Metadata service creation.
   - ‚úÖ Image processing integration.

### Immediate Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. üìã **Implement Image Analyzer Using Sharp**
   - Extract basic image properties (dimensions, format).
   - Calculate color depth and basic stats.

2. üìã **Add EXIF Extraction Functionality**
   - Integrate with Sharp for EXIF reading.
   - Parse and structure EXIF data.

3. üìã **Add Unit Tests**
   - Test image loading and processing.
   - Test supported file type filtering.
   - Test error cases.

4. üìã **Improve Error Handling and Logging**
   - Provide informative error messages.
   - Handle edge cases gracefully.

### Future Enhancements

- Advanced image analysis (histogram, color statistics).
- Python integration for ML features.
- Extended metadata persistence.
- Pipeline stage tracking.

## Implementation Details

### Metadata Extraction Components

1. **FileSystemAnalyzer**
   - Extracts file statistics using Node.js `fs` module.
   - Retrieves file permissions and timestamps.

2. **ImageAnalyzer**
   - Extracts image dimensions, color depth, format.
   - Computes basic image statistics.

3. **ExifExtractor**
   - Parses EXIF data for camera information, capture settings.
   - Extracts GPS data and software information.

4. **MetadataService**
   - Integrates FileSystemAnalyzer and ImageAnalyzer.
   - Processes images to extract comprehensive metadata.

### Notes

- Ensure that all asynchronous operations are properly handled.
- Consider adding support for more image formats in the future.
- Review code for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- Document all functions and modules for clarity and maintainability.
- Maintain high test coverage to ensure reliability and facilitate future enhancements.

## Current Sprint Tasks

- [x] Enhance main entry point to handle single file or directory input.
- [x] Complete implementation of `loadImagesFromDirectory` utility function.
- [ ] Implement Image Analyzer functionalities (dimensions, color depth, etc.).
- [ ] Integrate EXIF extraction into the metadata service.
- [ ] Develop comprehensive unit tests for existing modules.
- [ ] Refine error handling mechanisms across the service.
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect recent changes and implementations.
