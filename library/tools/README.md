# @luxcium/tools

The tool folder in the library directory serves as a Nursery, an Incubator of sorts for the tools that are being developed. The tools in this folder are not yet mature enough to be moved to their own folder in the library directory, or even in the context of the others directories of the monorepo.

## Tools

Here tools can mean anything from a simple utility function to a full blown application that would then remain in the tool folder or be moved, depending on its complexity and purpose, to its own folder in the library directory, or even in the context of the services directory, the API directory, the frontend directory, or the backend directory.
