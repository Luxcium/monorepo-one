### Introduction

This document provides a formal specification of the `Box` class concept. It outlines each detail and decision made in the design, ensuring that the structure can be consistently replicated and efficiently utilized in future developments. The focus is on establishing a foundational standard that can be extended with additional methods and functionalities as needed.

---

### Detailed Specification

#### Class Declaration

~~~typescript
class Box<T> {
    // Class body
}
~~~

- **Generic Type Parameter `T`**: The class is generic over a type parameter `T`, representing the type of the value it will contain. This allows the `Box` to encapsulate values of any type.

#### Private Field

~~~typescript
private _value: T;
~~~

- **Private `_value` Field**: Stores the encapsulated value. Being private ensures that the value cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class, enforcing encapsulation.

#### Protected Constructor

~~~typescript
protected constructor(value: T) {
    this._value = value;
}
~~~

- **Protected Access Modifier**: The constructor is `protected`, not `private`, to allow subclassing while preventing direct instantiation from outside the class hierarchy.
- **Parameter `value: T`**: Accepts a value of type `T` to initialize the `_value` field.

#### Static Factory Methods

##### `of` Method

~~~typescript
static of<TVal>(value: TVal): Box<TVal> {
    return new Box(value);
}
~~~

- **Purpose**: Serves as a factory method to create a new `Box` instance containing the provided value.
- **Generic Type Parameter `TVal`**: Allows the method to accept a value of any type, independent of the class's `T`.
- **Return Type**: Returns a new `Box<TVal>`, ensuring type consistency with the input value.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const numberBox = Box.of(42);
    console.log(numberBox.boxedValue); // Output: 42
    ```

##### `from` Method

~~~typescript
static from<TVal>(other: { unbox(): TVal }): Box<TVal> {
    return Box.of(other.unbox());
}
~~~

- **Purpose**: Creates a new `Box` instance by extracting the value from an object that implements an `unbox` method.
- **Generic Type Parameter `TVal`**: Ensures that the method can handle any type returned by `other.unbox()`.
- **Parameter `other`**: An object that must have an `unbox()` method returning a value of type `TVal`.
- **Usage of `Box.of`**: Utilizes the `of` method to create the new `Box`, maintaining consistency in object creation.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    class OtherBox {
        constructor(private value: string) {}
        unbox(): string {
            return this.value;
        }
    }

    const otherBox = new OtherBox("Hello, World!");
    const stringBox = Box.from(otherBox);
    console.log(stringBox.boxedValue); // Output: "Hello, World!"
    ```

#### Public Getter

~~~typescript
get boxedValue(): T {
    return this._value;
}
~~~

- **Purpose**: Provides read-only access to the encapsulated `_value`.
- **Access Modifier**: The getter is `public`, allowing external code to retrieve the value without direct access to the private field.

#### Unboxing Method

~~~typescript
unbox(): T {
    return this.boxedValue;
}
~~~

- **Purpose**: Returns the encapsulated value, providing a method to retrieve the value in a standardized way.
- **Return Type `T`**: Matches the type of the encapsulated value.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const box = Box.of(100);
    console.log(box.unbox()); // Output: 100
    ```

### Design Decisions and Rationale

#### Use of Generics (`T` and `TVal`)

- **`T` in Class Definition**: Represents the type of the value contained within the `Box` instance.
- **`TVal` in Static Methods**: Used in static methods to allow flexibility in the types of values that can be boxed, independent of any specific instance.
- **Type Consistency**: Using generics ensures that the type of the value is consistently tracked throughout the class, enhancing type safety and preventing type-related errors at compile time.

#### Return Types with `R`

- **Future Methods**: While the current methods return types based on `T` and `TVal`, future methods (e.g., transformations) may introduce a new generic type parameter `R` to represent a different return type.
- **Type Flexibility**: Introducing `R` in method definitions will allow methods to return types different from the input type, facilitating operations like mapping or transforming the encapsulated value without compromising type safety.

#### Exclusion of `map` Method

- **Current Scope**: The `map` method is intentionally excluded from the current system to focus on the foundational structure of the `Box` class.
- **Future Extension**: The `map` method and others will be defined and codified later, allowing for a step-by-step expansion of functionality without overcomplicating the initial design.
- **Rationale**: By deferring the inclusion of the `map` method, we maintain a clear focus on the core components of the `Box` class, ensuring that the foundational elements are solid and well-understood before introducing additional complexity.

#### Protected Constructor vs. Private Constructor

- **Protected Constructor**: Chosen to allow subclassing of `Box`, enabling the creation of specialized boxes that extend the base functionality while preventing direct instantiation from outside the class hierarchy.
- **Factory Methods**: By controlling instantiation through factory methods (`of` and `from`), we maintain control over how `Box` instances are created, ensuring consistency and allowing for additional processing or validation if needed in the future.
- **Rationale**: This approach balances encapsulation with extensibility, providing flexibility for future enhancements and specialized implementations.

### Ordering of Information

The information is organized to build from the basic structure to the specific details:

1. **Class Declaration**: Establishes the generic nature of the `Box`.
2. **Private Field**: Introduces encapsulation of the value.
3. **Protected Constructor**: Defines how instances are initialized.
4. **Static Factory Methods**: Details how instances are created without directly invoking the constructor.
5. **Public Getter and Methods**: Provides controlled access to the encapsulated value.
6. **Design Decisions and Rationale**: Explains the choices made during design, ensuring transparency and understanding.
7. **Future Considerations**: Prepares for extensions and additional functionalities, outlining the roadmap for the class's evolution.

By structuring the information in this way, we ensure that each component builds upon the previous ones, providing a clear and logical progression from basic concepts to detailed explanations. This methodical approach enhances comprehension and serves as an effective reference for developers.

### Future Considerations

#### Adding `map` Method

- **Purpose**: Introducing a `map` method will enhance the `Box` class's utility by allowing transformations of the encapsulated value, aligning with functor patterns commonly used in functional programming.
- **Potential Implementation**:

    ```typescript
    map<R>(fn: (value: T) => R): Box<R> {
        return Box.of(fn(this._value));
    }
    ```

- **Explanation**: The `map` method takes a function `fn` that transforms the value of type `T` into a new value of type `R`, and returns a new `Box<R>` containing the transformed value.
- **Benefits**:
    - Enables chaining of transformations in a concise and readable manner.
    - Promotes immutability by returning new instances rather than modifying existing ones.

#### Additional Methods

- **Specialized Methods**: Other methods specific to certain use cases can be added, each following the codified standards established here.
- **Examples**:
    - **`filter` Method**: Could allow conditional selection of values.
    - **`flatMap` Method**: For handling nested `Box` instances.
- **Method Naming and Structure**: All additional methods should maintain consistent naming conventions and method signatures to ensure interoperability and predictability.

#### Consistent Standards

- **Adherence to Codification**: All future extensions must adhere to the principles and structure defined in this codification to maintain consistency and predictability across all `Box` variations.
- **Documentation and Testing**:
    - **Documentation**: Each new method or extension should be thoroughly documented, explaining its purpose, usage, and any implications.
    - **Testing**: Comprehensive tests should be written to validate the behavior of new methods, ensuring reliability and correctness.
- **Interoperability**: Extensions should consider compatibility with existing methods and patterns to maintain a cohesive design.
