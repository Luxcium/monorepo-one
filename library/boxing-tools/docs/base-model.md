# Box Class Specification

This document provides a comprehensive formal specification of the `Box<T>` class concept, version 1.0. The `Box<T>` class serves as a fundamental container type that encapsulates values while providing a consistent interface for value access and manipulation. This specification defines the exact structure and layout of the `Box<T>` class, establishing it as a prototype for future box implementations.

## Introduction

The `Box<T>` class is designed to encapsulate a single value of any type, providing controlled access and standardized methods for interacting with the contained value. This prototype ensures consistency, simplicity, and efficiency, serving as the foundational structure for more complex box variants. By adhering to this specification, developers can create various box types that maintain uniform behavior and interface.

## Class Declaration

The `Box<T>` class is declared with a generic type parameter `T`, allowing it to encapsulate values of any specified type.

```typescript
public class Box<T> {
    // Class body
}
```

The generic type parameter `T` ensures type safety and flexibility, enabling the `Box` to handle diverse data types seamlessly. The `public` access modifier is used here for clarity in this example, though class-level access is `public` by default in TypeScript.

## Generic Type Parameters

The `Box<T>` class uses a generic type parameter to provide flexibility in the types of values it can contain.

### Type Parameter `T`

This type parameter defines the core behavior of the `Box<T>` class by setting the type of the value that will be encapsulated.

- **Definition**: Represents the type of the value contained within the `Box` instance.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the `Box` can encapsulate any data type while maintaining type integrity.
- **Usage**: Applied to class methods and properties to enforce type consistency across different operations.

## Private Field

The `Box<T>` class contains a single private field `_value` that stores the encapsulated value. This field is designed to ensure encapsulation and protect the integrity of the contained data.

```typescript
private _value: T;
```

- **Encapsulation**: The `_value` field is private, preventing direct external access or modification. This ensures controlled interaction through defined methods, maintaining a strict encapsulation principle.
- **Purpose**: Holds the actual value contained within the `Box`, establishing a clear and simple structure for the prototype.

## Protected Constructor

The constructor of the `Box<T>` class is protected, restricting direct instantiation and allowing subclassing where necessary. This design choice encourages the use of factory methods to create instances of the `Box<T>` class, ensuring that the creation process remains consistent and controlled.

```typescript
protected constructor(value: T) {
    this._value = value;
}
```

- **Access Modifier**: `protected` ensures that only the `Box` class and its subclasses can invoke the constructor, preserving encapsulation while allowing flexibility for subclassing.
- **Parameter**: Accepts a value of type `T` to initialize the `_value` field, setting the encapsulated value for the instance.
- **Purpose**: Enforces the use of factory methods for creating instances, promoting controlled and consistent object creation across different usages.

## Static Factory Methods

The `Box<T>` class provides two static factory methods, `of` and `from`, to facilitate instance creation in a controlled and standardized manner. These methods ensure consistent object creation and enable extensibility for various types of boxed values.

### `of` Method

The `of` method serves as the primary factory method for creating new `Box` instances. This method is designed to be flexible, allowing the `Box` class to encapsulate values of different types based on the input parameter.

```typescript
public static of<TVal>(value: TVal): Box<TVal> {
    return new Box(value);
}
```

- **Purpose**: Creates a new `Box` instance containing the provided value.
- **Generic Type Parameter `TVal`**: Allows the method to accept a value of any type, independent of the class's `T`, enabling flexibility.
- **Return Type**: Returns a new `Box<TVal>`, ensuring type consistency with the input value and supporting type inference.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const numberBox = Box.of(42);
    console.log(numberBox.boxedValue); // Output: 42
    ```

### `from` Method

The `from` method enables the creation of `Box` instances from other objects that implement an `unbox` method. This approach allows interoperability with other box types that follow similar unboxing conventions, promoting compatibility across different implementations.

```typescript
public static from<TVal>(other: { unbox(): TVal }): Box<TVal> {
    return Box.of(other.unbox());
}
```

- **Purpose**: Extracts the value from an object implementing `unbox` and encapsulates it within a new `Box`, enabling seamless value boxing from external types.
- **Generic Type Parameter `TVal`**: Ensures that the method can handle any type returned by `other.unbox()`, providing flexibility and compatibility.
- **Parameter `other`**: An object that must have an `unbox()` method returning a value of type `TVal`, aligning with the prototype's requirement for unbox compatibility.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    class OtherBox {
        constructor(private value: string) {}
        public unbox(): string {
            return this.value;
        }
    }

    const otherBox = new OtherBox("Hello, World!");
    const stringBox = Box.from(otherBox);
    console.log(stringBox.boxedValue); // Output: "Hello, World!"
    ```

## Public Getter

The `Box<T>` class provides a public getter `boxedValue` to access the encapsulated value in a read-only manner. This method ensures that the value can be retrieved without exposing it to modification.

```typescript
public get boxedValue(): T {
    return this._value;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Allows external code to retrieve the encapsulated value without modifying it, ensuring immutability for external access.
- **Access Modifier**: `public`, enabling broad accessibility while maintaining encapsulation by restricting modifications.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const box = Box.of(100);
    console.log(box.boxedValue); // Output: 100
    ```

## Unboxing Method

The `Box<T>` class includes an `unbox` method to retrieve the encapsulated value in a standardized way, allowing the contained value to be extracted while maintaining control over the unboxing process.

```typescript
public unbox(): T {
    return this.boxedValue;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a method to extract the value contained within the `Box`, ensuring a consistent unboxing approach across implementations.
- **Return Type `T`**: Ensures that the method returns the same type as the encapsulated value, supporting type consistency in extracted values.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const box = Box.of(100);
    console.log(box.unbox()); // Output: 100
    ```

## Design Decisions and Rationale

This section explains the key design decisions underlying the `Box<T>` class, ensuring that each choice supports the simplicity and extensibility of the prototype.

### Use of Generics (`T` and `TVal`)

Generics are utilized to ensure that the `Box<T>` class can encapsulate values of various types while maintaining type safety.

- **`T` in Class Definition**: Represents the type of the value contained within the `Box` instance, ensuring type safety and flexibility.
- **`TVal` in Static Methods**: Used in the `of` and `from` methods to allow flexibility in the types of values that can be boxed, independent of any specific instance.
- **Type Consistency**: Generics ensure that the type of the value is consistently tracked throughout the class, enhancing type safety and preventing type-related errors at compile time.

### Protected Constructor vs. Private Constructor

The `Box<T>` class employs a protected constructor to balance encapsulation with extensibility, allowing for subclassing while restricting direct instantiation.

- **Protected Constructor**: Chosen to allow subclassing of `Box`, enabling the creation of specialized boxes that extend the base functionality while preventing direct instantiation from outside the class hierarchy.
- **Factory Methods**: By controlling instantiation through factory methods (`of` and `from`), we maintain control over how `Box` instances are created, ensuring consistency and allowing for additional processing or validation if needed in the future.
- **Rationale**: This approach supports encapsulation and extensibility, allowing for diverse box types to be built upon the base prototype.
