# Box Class Specification

This document provides a comprehensive formal specification of the `Box<T>` class concept, version 1.0. The `Box<T>` class serves as a fundamental container type that encapsulates values while providing a consistent interface for value access and manipulation. This specification outlines the exact structure and layout of the `Box<T>` class, establishing it as a prototype for future box implementations.

## Introduction

The `Box<T>` class is designed to encapsulate a single value of any type, providing controlled access and standardized methods for interacting with the contained value. This prototype ensures consistency, simplicity, and efficiency, serving as the foundational structure for more complex box variants. By adhering to this specification, developers can create various box types that maintain uniform behavior and interface.

## Class Declaration

The `Box<T>` class is declared with a generic type parameter `T`, allowing it to encapsulate values of any specified type.

```typescript
class Box<T> {
    // Class body
}
```

The generic type parameter `T` ensures type safety and flexibility, enabling the `Box` to handle diverse data types seamlessly.

## Generic Type Parameters

### Type Parameter `T`

- **Definition**: Represents the type of the value contained within the `Box` instance.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the `Box` can encapsulate any data type while maintaining type integrity.
- **Usage**: Applied to class methods and properties to enforce type consistency.

## Private Field

The `Box<T>` class contains a single private field `_value` that stores the encapsulated value.

```typescript
private _value: T;
```

- **Encapsulation**: The `_value` field is private, preventing direct external access or modification. This enforces controlled interaction through defined methods.
- **Purpose**: Holds the actual value contained within the `Box`.

## Protected Constructor

The constructor of the `Box<T>` class is protected, restricting direct instantiation and allowing subclassing.

```typescript
protected constructor(value: T) {
    this._value = value;
}
```

- **Access Modifier**: `protected` ensures that only the `Box` class and its subclasses can invoke the constructor.
- **Parameter**: Accepts a value of type `T` to initialize the `_value` field.
- **Purpose**: Enforces the use of factory methods for creating instances, promoting controlled and consistent object creation.

## Static Factory Methods

The `Box<T>` class provides two static factory methods, `of` and `from`, to facilitate instance creation in a controlled manner.

### `of` Method

The `of` method serves as the primary factory method for creating new `Box` instances.

```typescript
static of<TVal>(value: TVal): Box<TVal> {
    return new Box(value);
}
```

- **Purpose**: Creates a new `Box` instance containing the provided value.
- **Generic Type Parameter `TVal`**: Allows the method to accept a value of any type, independent of the class's `T`.
- **Return Type**: Returns a new `Box<TVal>`, ensuring type consistency with the input value.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const numberBox = Box.of(42);
    console.log(numberBox.boxedValue); // Output: 42
    ```

### `from` Method

The `from` method enables the creation of `Box` instances from other objects that implement an `unbox` method.

```typescript
static from<TVal>(other: { unbox(): TVal }): Box<TVal> {
    return Box.of(other.unbox());
}
```

- **Purpose**: Extracts the value from an object implementing `unbox` and encapsulates it within a new `Box`.
- **Generic Type Parameter `TVal`**: Ensures that the method can handle any type returned by `other.unbox()`.
- **Parameter `other`**: An object that must have an `unbox()` method returning a value of type `TVal`.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    class OtherBox {
        constructor(private value: string) {}
        unbox(): string {
            return this.value;
        }
    }

    const otherBox = new OtherBox("Hello, World!");
    const stringBox = Box.from(otherBox);
    console.log(stringBox.boxedValue); // Output: "Hello, World!"
    ```

## Public Getter

The `Box<T>` class provides a public getter `boxedValue` to access the encapsulated value in a read-only manner.

```typescript
get boxedValue(): T {
    return this._value;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Allows external code to retrieve the encapsulated value without modifying it.
- **Access Modifier**: `public`, enabling broad accessibility while maintaining immutability.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const box = Box.of(100);
    console.log(box.boxedValue); // Output: 100
    ```

## Unboxing Method

The `Box<T>` class includes an `unbox` method to retrieve the encapsulated value in a standardized way.

```typescript
unbox(): T {
    return this.boxedValue;
}
```

- **Purpose**: Provides a method to extract the value contained within the `Box`.
- **Return Type `T`**: Ensures that the method returns the same type as the encapsulated value.
- **Usage Example**:

    ```typescript
    const box = Box.of(100);
    console.log(box.unbox()); // Output: 100
    ```

## Design Decisions and Rationale

This section explains the key design decisions that shape the `Box<T>` class implementation. Each decision is carefully considered to balance flexibility, safety, and usability.

### Use of Generics (`T` and `TVal`)

- **`T` in Class Definition**: Represents the type of the value contained within the `Box` instance, ensuring type safety and flexibility.
- **`TVal` in Static Methods**: Used in the `of` and `from` methods to allow flexibility in the types of values that can be boxed, independent of any specific instance.
- **Type Consistency**: Generics ensure that the type of the value is consistently tracked throughout the class, enhancing type safety and preventing type-related errors at compile time.

### Return Types with `R`

- **Future Methods**: While the current methods return types based on `T` and `TVal`, future methods (e.g., transformations) may introduce a new generic type parameter `R` to represent a different return type.
- **Type Flexibility**: Introducing `R` in method definitions will allow methods to return types different from the input type, facilitating operations like mapping or transforming the encapsulated value without compromising type safety.

### Exclusion of `map` Method

- **Current Scope**: The `map` method is intentionally excluded from the current system to focus on the foundational structure of the `Box` class.
- **Future Extension**: The `map` method and others will be defined and codified later, allowing for a step-by-step expansion of functionality without overcomplicating the initial design.
- **Rationale**: By deferring the inclusion of the `map` method, we maintain a clear focus on the core components of the `Box` class, ensuring that the foundational elements are solid and well-understood before introducing additional complexity.

### Protected Constructor vs. Private Constructor

- **Protected Constructor**: Chosen to allow subclassing of `Box`, enabling the creation of specialized boxes that extend the base functionality while preventing direct instantiation from outside the class hierarchy.
- **Factory Methods**: By controlling instantiation through factory methods (`of` and `from`), we maintain control over how `Box` instances are created, ensuring consistency and allowing for additional processing or validation if needed in the future.
- **Rationale**: This approach balances encapsulation with extensibility, providing flexibility for future enhancements and specialized implementations.

## Ordering of Information

The information in this specification is organized to build from the basic structure to the specific details, ensuring clarity and logical progression.

1. **Class Declaration**: Establishes the generic nature of the `Box`.
2. **Private Field**: Introduces encapsulation of the value.
3. **Protected Constructor**: Defines how instances are initialized.
4. **Static Factory Methods**: Details how instances are created without directly invoking the constructor.
5. **Public Getter and Methods**: Provides controlled access to the encapsulated value.
6. **Design Decisions and Rationale**: Explains the choices made during design, ensuring transparency and understanding.
7. **Future Considerations**: Prepares for extensions and additional functionalities, outlining the roadmap for the class's evolution.

By structuring the information in this way, each component builds upon the previous ones, providing a clear and logical progression from basic concepts to detailed explanations. This methodical approach enhances comprehension and serves as an effective reference for developers.

## Future Considerations

The `Box<T>` class design anticipates future extensions and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility. Future developments will adhere to the established standards to ensure consistency and reliability.

### Adding `map` Method

- **Purpose**: Introducing a `map` method will enhance the `Box` class's utility by allowing transformations of the encapsulated value, aligning with functor patterns commonly used in functional programming.
- **Potential Implementation**:

    ```typescript
    map<R>(fn: (value: T) => R): Box<R> {
        return Box.of(fn(this._value));
    }
    ```

- **Explanation**: The `map` method takes a function `fn` that transforms the value of type `T` into a new value of type `R`, and returns a new `Box<R>` containing the transformed value.
- **Benefits**:
    - **Chaining Transformations**: Enables chaining of transformations in a concise and readable manner.
    - **Immutability**: Promotes immutability by returning new instances rather than modifying existing ones.

### Additional Methods

- **Specialized Methods**: Other methods specific to certain use cases can be added, each following the codified standards established here.
- **Examples**:
    - **`filter` Method**: Could allow conditional selection of values based on a predicate function.
    - **`flatMap` Method**: For handling nested `Box` instances, enabling flattening of multiple layers.
- **Method Naming and Structure**: All additional methods should maintain consistent naming conventions and method signatures to ensure interoperability and predictability.

### Consistent Standards

- **Adherence to Codification**: All future extensions must adhere to the principles and structure defined in this specification to maintain consistency and predictability across all `Box` variations.
- **Documentation and Testing**:
    - **Documentation**: Each new method or extension should be thoroughly documented, explaining its purpose, usage, and any implications.
    - **Testing**: Comprehensive tests should be written to validate the behavior of new methods, ensuring reliability and correctness.
- **Interoperability**: Extensions should consider compatibility with existing methods and patterns to maintain a cohesive design.
