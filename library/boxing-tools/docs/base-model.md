# Box Class Specification

This document provides a comprehensive formal specification of the `Box` class concept, version 1.0. The Box class serves as a fundamental container type that encapsulates values while providing a consistent interface for value access and manipulation.

## Core Concepts

The Box class implementation follows strict object-oriented principles and functional programming patterns to create a robust and flexible value container. This section outlines the fundamental concepts and design philosophy behind the Box class.

### Class Structure

The Box class is designed with a generic type parameter and protected construction to ensure type safety and controlled instantiation. Below are the key structural elements that form the foundation of the Box class.

#### Class Declaration

The class is declared with a generic type parameter `T` to provide type-safe value encapsulation:

```typescript
class Box<T> {
    // Class body
}
```

#### Private Field

A private field stores the encapsulated value, ensuring proper data hiding:

```typescript
private _value: T;
```

#### Protected Constructor

The constructor is protected to enable inheritance while preventing direct instantiation:

```typescript
protected constructor(value: T) {
    this._value = value;
}
```

### Factory Methods

The Box class provides static factory methods as the primary means of instance creation. These methods ensure consistent object creation and enable future extensibility.

#### Creation with 'of'

The `of` method serves as the primary factory method for creating new Box instances:

```typescript
static of<TVal>(value: TVal): Box<TVal> {
    return new Box(value);
}
```

#### Creation with 'from'

The `from` method enables creation of Box instances from other unboxable types:

```typescript
static from<TVal>(other: { unbox(): TVal }): Box<TVal> {
    return Box.of(other.unbox());
}
```

### Value Access

The Box class provides controlled access to its encapsulated value through well-defined methods and properties.

#### Getter Method

A public getter provides read-only access to the boxed value:

```typescript
get boxedValue(): T {
    return this._value;
}
```

#### Unboxing Operation

The unbox method provides a standardized way to extract the contained value:

```typescript
unbox(): T {
    return this.boxedValue;
}
```

## Design Decisions

This section explains the key design decisions that shape the Box class implementation. Each decision is carefully considered to balance flexibility, safety, and usability.

### Type System Choices

The type system implementation focuses on maintaining type safety while providing flexibility in value handling.

#### Generic Parameters

The use of generic type parameters (`T` and `TVal`) enables type-safe operations while maintaining flexibility:

- `T` represents the type of the contained value in instance methods
- `TVal` provides type independence in static factory methods

#### Return Type Flexibility

The design allows for future methods to use different return types through an additional generic parameter `R`, enabling transformation operations while maintaining type safety.

### Constructor Access

The decision to use a protected constructor instead of a private one was made to enable inheritance while maintaining controlled instantiation:

- Allows creation of specialized Box subclasses
- Prevents direct instantiation outside the class hierarchy
- Enforces the use of factory methods for instance creation

## Future Considerations

The Box class design anticipates future extensions and improvements while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Method Extensions

Future versions may include additional methods to enhance functionality:

#### Mapping Operations

A `map` method will be added to enable value transformations:

```typescript
map<R>(fn: (value: T) => R): Box<R> {
    return Box.of(fn(this._value));
}
```

#### Additional Utilities

Other potential extensions include:

- Filter operations for conditional value handling
- Flatten operations for nested Box instances
- Combination operations for multiple Box instances

### Standards and Practices

Future development will adhere to established standards:

- Consistent method naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation requirements
- Thorough testing practices
- Backward compatibility considerations

## Conclusion

The Box class specification provides a solid foundation for value encapsulation with clear guidelines for implementation and future development. This design ensures consistency, type safety, and extensibility while maintaining simplicity and usability.
