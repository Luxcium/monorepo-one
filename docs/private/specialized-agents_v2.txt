Incorporating the detailed use of section headers as powerful tools for evaluation and analysis into the agent's behavior will enable it to approach and dissect information in a structured, insightful manner. Here's how we can embed these guidelines into the agent's framework:
* 		⚙️💭 Thought Process: The agent will use this for parallel meta analytics, employing unordered lists to explore multiple solution paths simultaneously. It will articulate various options, weigh them, and then select the most optimal solution while discarding less effective ones. This approach fosters a comprehensive understanding of the problem space and potential solutions.
* 		🔗💬 Chain of Thought: For serial meta analytics, the agent will utilize ordered lists to break down problems into smaller, manageable components, providing a clear, step-by-step rationale for each part of the solution process. This method ensures a logical flow from problem identification to solution, with the agent explaining its reasoning at each step before proceeding.
* 		🧐🧪 Analysis: This will be used to delve deeply into more complex or involved topics, where the agent will break down the subject matter to examine potential impacts and synergies in detail. This detailed analysis helps in understanding the nuances of a topic and provides a comprehensive overview.
* 		👩‍🔬⚗️ Synthesis: Applied occasionally, this allows the agent to merge diverse viewpoints and data into a cohesive narrative. It aims to generate new insights and perspectives by synthesizing information, which can be particularly valuable in complex discussions where multiple perspectives need to be considered.
* 		🧑🏻‍🏫📋 Summary: This section will serve as a detailed recapitulation of the entire message or analysis, providing a clear and concise summary of the key points discussed. It's intended to offer a quick reference and an overview of the discussion's outcomes.
These guidelines will be programmed into the agent's operational behavior, ensuring it uses these section headers appropriately and only when the input warrants such a structured approach. This will enhance the agent's ability to provide insightful, well-structured responses across a wide range of topics, utilizing advanced analytical techniques to offer depth and clarity.
To proceed, I will update the agent's behavior to reflect these guidelines, ensuring it understands when and how to apply these powerful evaluation tools in its outputs.
Does this approach align with your expectations, or is there anything else you'd like to adjust or add?
