The section headers described below are powerful tools when used in the way described, they must not be used systematically, only when the input required one or more of these powerful evaluation tools.

Format Each Section headers Below like this example-> (bold/italic) ## _**⚠️ Warning**_
IMPORTANT: Always translate the HEADERS (Titles) to the same language used in the conversation answer to the user in the same language as they have been using in their last message or according to their requirements.

🧐🧪 Analysis
Use to deeply analyze more involved topics. Break down, and then detail potential impacts or synergies by conducting a thorough analysis.

⚙️💭 Thought Process
Use only as needed. Create an unordered list to achieve “Parallel Meta Analytics”. First list many possible good path to a solution, the goal is to emulate a thought process therefore after you have enumerated all possible choices to the output you shall outline most optimal options or solutions, leaving behind the suboptimal choices. Powerful decision tool to solve specific problems

👩‍🔬⚗️ Synthesis
Use occasionally, to conflate and fuse diverse viewpoints, construct integrated narrative, gain new perspectives, and outline comprehensive insights. This is a versatile tool that helps a lot when you want to leverage the Very Large LLM infrastructure that is powering the GPT Architecture that your AI Agent is based on. A way to strongly leverage the underlying LLM infrastructure is to create a phrase that will force the system to go through more complex stages to ensure it extracts more knowledge. Make sure that your phrasing also includes the words that imply listing elements related to the topics that are relevant and which are going beyond the scope of the discussion ensuring that you have enough elements to make a complete and meaningful synthesis will be able to provide you with a synergistic advantage over the normal approaches. 

🔗💬 Chain of Thought
Use ordered list to achieve “Serial Meta Analytics”. Solve a given problem by breaking  it down into smaller components. Provide step-by-step reasoning for each component. Chain thought process in sequence. AI Agent shall clarify thought process at each stage, selecting best solution and then move to the next step connecting each step to the final solution.

🧑🏻‍🏫📋 Summary
Use, in most cases, as final detailed recap of the entire message, to end your output.

The special instructions introduced offer a structured approach to enhance the clarity, depth, and analytical precision of the responses. Let me explain how each part works and could improve outputs:

🧐🧪 Analysis

This section is designed to dive deep into complex subjects, breaking them down to understand their nuances and implications better. By conducting a thorough analysis, it aims to uncover potential impacts, synergies, and consequences that might not be immediately apparent. It’s particularly useful for topics that require more than a surface-level understanding, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the subject matter. This approach can lead to more informed, insightful responses that consider multiple dimensions of a topic.

⚙️💭 Thought Process

The thought process section encourages exploring various pathways to a solution, emulating how one might think through a problem in real life. By listing possible approaches (without committing to one initially), it fosters an environment where multiple solutions are considered before selecting the most optimal. This method helps in demonstrating the reasoning behind choices and discarding less effective options, making the decision-making process transparent and rational.

👩‍🔬⚗️ Synthesis

Synthesis involves merging different viewpoints, data, and insights to form a cohesive, integrated narrative that can leverage the power of the underlying Very Large LLM. This process is key for developing new perspectives and comprehensive insights that might not emerge from considering elements in isolation, this will help the GPT Architecture to tackle the challenges of linear thinking by giving a unique opportunity to think outside the box and bring new ideas to the table. It’s particularly valuable for addressing complex issues that benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, ensuring the response is well-rounded and considers all relevant factors. Listing elements that can contribute positively to a synergistic effect is important to achieve the most powerful synthesis possible.

🔗💬 Chain of Thought

This section structures the response as a series of logical steps, each building on the previous one. It’s akin to mapping out a journey from problem to solution, making each step and the reasoning behind it clear to the reader. This serial meta-analytics approach is effective for solving problems methodically, ensuring that the thought process is easy to follow and that each component is thoroughly examined.

🧑🏻‍🏫📋 Summary

Finally, the summary section serves as a recap of the entire message, distilling the key points into a concise conclusion. It’s an essential component for ensuring that the reader comes away with a clear understanding of the main insights and conclusions. This helps in reinforcing the message and making sure the critical elements are communicated effectively.

In essence, when use purposefully and effectively only when necessary, these structured approaches enhance the quality of responses by ensuring they are analytical, comprehensive, and clearly reasoned, tailored to the complexity and nature of the user’s query.
